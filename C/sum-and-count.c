/*
Given Sum and Count. You can use the only integer from 1-9 (can use more than one time) to make the Sum. The restriction is that the number of the element should be equal to Count. Find all possible combinations.
Example:
Sum = 10 and Count = 2
Result is (1, 9), (2, 8), (3, 7), (4, 6) and (5, 5)
1 + 9 = 10
2 + 8 = 10
3 + 7 = 10
4 + 6 = 10
5 + 5 = 10
