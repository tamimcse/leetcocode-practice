/*
Reverse Bits: Given a 32 bit number X, reverse its binary form and print the answer in decimal.

Input:
X = 1
Output:
2147483648 
Explanation:
Binary of 1 in 32 bits representation-
00000000000000000000000000000001
Reversing the binary form we get, 
10000000000000000000000000000000,
whose decimal value is 2147483648.

Input:
X = 5
Output:
2684354560 
Explanation:
Binary of 5 in 32 bits representation-
00000000000000000000000000000101
Reversing the binary form we get, 
10100000000000000000000000000000,
whose decimal value is 2684354560.
