1. Palindrome - an integer is a palindrome when it reads the same backward as forward. For example, 121 is a palindrome while 123 is not.

2. Ask if input consists of just letter, or any ASCII character. For instance, in https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-substring-without-repeating-characters/, I thought it will only contain english letter, and I use arr[26] as a hash. This is not right. The input can contain both upper case and lower case. More importantly, it can contain any ascii charecter.

3. Note that, there are 256 ascii characters.

4. In  sliding window implementation, you can start end = [0 - end] and increase start on the way

5. Suppose you are given https://leetcode.com/problems/median-of-two-sorted-arrays/. You need to asked to solve in log (n + m). How would you do that? Actually, if you use two pointers for two arrays, it's actually log (n + m). This is because you don't need to iterate the whole array. Actually, no that's not right. If you use simple, two pointers, it's O(n+m). However, I saw my solution  was accepted and it was faster that 99...% solutions

6. https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-integer/. Here, I thought, I will have to rotate the number in each step up to n times (n = num of digits). If you think clearly, if you ratate a number n times, you will get the same number. If you rotate n - 1 times, it will still give you wrong results. To get the right results, you need to swap between start and end.
