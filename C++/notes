1. Palindrome - an integer is a palindrome when it reads the same backward as forward. For example, 121 is a palindrome while 123 is not.

2. Ask if input consists of just letter, or any ASCII character. For instance, in https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-substring-without-repeating-characters/, I thought it will only contain english letter, and I use arr[26] as a hash. This is not right. The input can contain both upper case and lower case. More importantly, it can contain any ascii charecter.

3. Note that, there are 256 ascii characters.

4. In  sliding window implementation, you can start end = [0 - end] and increase start on the way
