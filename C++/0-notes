1. Palindrome - an integer is a palindrome when it reads the same backward as forward. For example, 121 is a palindrome while 123 is not.

2. Ask if input consists of just letter, or any ASCII character. For instance, in https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-substring-without-repeating-characters/, I thought it will only contain english letter, and I use arr[26] as a hash. This is not right. The input can contain both upper case and lower case. More importantly, it can contain any ascii charecter.

3. Note that, there are 256 ascii characters.

4. In  sliding window implementation, you can start end = [0 - end] and increase start on the way

5. Suppose you are given https://leetcode.com/problems/median-of-two-sorted-arrays/. You need to asked to solve in log (n + m). How would you do that? Actually, if you use two pointers for two arrays, it's actually log (n + m). This is because you don't need to iterate the whole array. Actually, no that's not right. If you use simple, two pointers, it's O(n+m). However, I saw my solution  was accepted and it was faster that 99...% solutions

6. https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-integer/. Here, I thought, I will have to rotate the number in each step up to n times (n = num of digits). If you think clearly, if you ratate a number n times, you will get the same number. If you rotate n - 1 times, it will still give you wrong results. To get the right results, you need to swap between start and end.

7. We know that C++ string is immutatable. If we append or use '+' operator, it creates a new copy of the object. So, you may want to create a sring of a predefined length. You can do that as:

        string res(str_len, 0);//Here, we are assigning 0/NULL to each element of the string
        
8. https://leetcode.com/problems/base-7/. How many characters do you need for base 7? How do you convert a number from base 10 to base 7?

Recall that, for base-10 numbers, we can calculate the number of digits as = log10(num) + 1. It will work for any number, for instance, 99, 100,...

In the same way, base-2 number, the number of binary digits is = log2(num) + 1.

In the same way, for base-7 number, the number of digits = log7(num) + 1.

How to calculate log7(num)? There is no such library function.

log7(num) = log10(num) / log10(7).

Note that, this will not work if the number is negative. So, if the number is negative, you need to make it positive and then process it.


How do calculate base-7 number from base-10? 

Recall that, in Base-16, we divide by 16 in each step, and get the quotient (result of the division) and remainder. We divide the quotient again by 16. We repeat these utill quotient is 0. Like:

16 |45
   |---------------------
16 |2 - 13 (D)
   -----------------------
   |0  - 2 (2)
   
So, Hex of 45 is 2D   

In the same way, for base-7, we need to divide by 7.

Will this work if input is 0? No. You need to handle 0 separately. If the number is negative, you also need to make the number positive first.

9. https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-linked-list/ Here, I need to set head = nullptr.

10. https://leetcode.com/problems/convert-sorted-array-to-binary-search-tree/ Here, we can use mid = (start + end) >> 1

11. https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-bits/. Note that reversing is not same as circulating. I often make this mistake. Remember string reverse procedure

12. https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-bits/ Here, if (n & mask2 == 0) will not work. It should be if ((n & mask2) == 0)

13. https://leetcode.com/problems/linked-list-cycle-ii/. Detecting cycle is easy. How would you find the start of the cycle?

Don't go into theory. That's just for correctness proof. Idea is only you find the intersection of fast and slow pointer, do the following. Have ptr1 point the head and have ptr2 point the intersection. Then go only one step at a time for both case. When they meet, that's the start of the cycle.

14. https://leetcode.com/problems/invert-binary-tree/

Here, I set left-subtree = invert(right-subtree). Problem here is it will update the tree in place. Don't do that. Create a temp, left, right. Then update the tree based on left and right as:

        TreeNode *left = invertTree (root->right);
        TreeNode *right = invertTree (root->left);
        root->left = left;
        root->right = right;

15. https://leetcode.com/problems/sqrtx/

A binary search needs to be in the form:

while (end >= start) {//Not end > start
  mid = (start + end) >> 1;
  if (target == arr[mid])
    return mid;
  else if (target > arr[mid])
    start = mid + 1;//NOT start = mid (leads to infinite loop)
  else
    end = mid - 1;  //NOT end = mid (leads to infinite loop)
}

Also, in the problem, don't do:

 if ((x + 1) * (x + 1) > target) 
 
 What's wrong here? It may overflow for some input. Even if(x + x > target) or if (x * x > target) may overflow.
 
 If you need to calculate sum or multiplication of int/float, check if you need "long long" (for int) or "double" (for float) to store it. Otherwise overflow happens. If you need long long or double, also change the expression to make sure that longlong or double is stored. For instance,

int a, b;
long long sum;

sum = (long long)a + b;

Just changing to long long inline doesn't work.

In some cases, you may not need "long long". Just "long" is enough.

16. https://leetcode.com/problems/kth-largest-element-in-a-stream/

What's wrong with the code?

	vector<int> nums;
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.size() - k; i++) {

        }
        
Here, nums.size() is unsigned. If nums.size() - k is negative, that expression will accidentally create a large number. So, the loop will mistakenly run many iteration whearas it shouldn't iterate at all.
        
Following doesn't fix it.


        for (int i = 0; i < (int)nums.size() - k; i++) {

        }
        
This however fixes it:
        
        int num_delete = nums.size() - k;
        for (int i = 0; i < num_delete; i++) {

        }
        
17. https://leetcode.com/problems/power-of-three/ 

Look at the following solution:

    bool isPowerOfThree(int n) {
        if (n <= 0)
            return false;
        
       float x = (float)log10(n) / log10(3);
       return ceil(x) == x;//See how we are checking if x is an integer.
    }
    
    What's wrong with the code? Here, it should be:
    
    double x = log10(n) / log10(3);
    
    Casting it to float may lose precision, which causes wrong result. Also, x should be double.
    
18. https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/position-of-rightmost-set-bit/

The process is:
     
    unsigned int getFirstSetBitPos(int n)
    {
        return log2(n & -n) + 1;
    }
    
    If you take negative of the number (two's complement) and & it with the original #, all the bits except the right most one is set. Then, use log to calculate the bit position.
    
    For instance, n = 100011100
    
    One's complement of n = 011100011
    Two's complement of n = 011100100. This is -n
    
    Now, n & -n = 100.

20. https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-days-between-two-dates/. How to solve this? Trying to implement distance between them is hard/messy to implement. But, if you try to calculate # of days since 1970, that's clean to implemt. So, implement that, and then take the distance as:

class Solution {
    bool is_leapyear(int year) {
        if (year % 100 == 0)
            return year % 400 == 0;
        return (year % 4 == 0);
    }
    
    int since_epoc (string date) {
        int months[] = {0, 31, 28, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31};
        int year = stoi(date.substr(0, 4));
        int mon = stoi(date.substr(5, 2));
        int day = stoi(date.substr(8));
        
        int i = 1970;
        while (year > i) {
            day += is_leapyear(i) ? 366 : 365;
            i++;
        }
        for (int i = 1; i <= mon - 1; i++) {
            day += months[i];
            if (i == 2 && is_leapyear(year))
                day++;
        }
        return day;
    }
public:
    int daysBetweenDates(string date1, string date2) {
        //cout << since_epoc (date2);
        return abs(since_epoc (date2) -  since_epoc (date1));
    }
};

Note how we represented # of days in a month. That's more clean than having switch/if to clauclate it.

21. https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-square/

Very interesting problem. Try to find how you would solve it. 

Trick is to sort the numbers. That way, you know what is the bottom left and top right.

22. https://leetcode.com/problems/snakes-and-ladders/

How would you convert <x, y> to the number? Think in terms of math. Here, we are doing that:

            for (int j = 0; j < board.size(); j++) {
                if (right)
                    jump[(board.size() - 1 - i) * board.size() + j + 1] = board[i][j];
                else
                    jump[(board.size() - 1 - i) * board.size() + (board.size() - 1- j) + 1] = board[i][j];

        }   
    
23. https://leetcode.com/problems/product-of-array-except-self/

How can you implement this without using division?

You can have two arrays L and R. L will contain multiplication of all the number to the left of index i. R will contain multiplication of all the number to the right of index i.
Then for each index, you can do L[i] * R[i]     


24. https://leetcode.com/problems/3sum/

Here, challenge is how to make sure you don't put same result twice?

You may try to use hash. But, it will not work. Beacuse, the numbers inside result will not be in the same order. Besides, you iterate samrtly so that you can avoid duplicate.

First of all, sort the array. In outer array, check if the number you are dealing is same as the previous number. If yes, you can skip that.

In the inner array where you are doing two sum, if you find a match for a number, increase the index until the next number is same as the previous number. 

The code will look as following:

class Solution {
public:
    vector<vector<int>> threeSum(vector<int>& nums) {
        vector<vector<int>> res;
        int target_sum;
        
        sort (nums.begin(), nums.end());////<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.size() - 2; i++) {
            if (i > 0 && nums[i] == nums[i-1]) {////<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<
                continue;
            }
            target_sum = 0 - nums[i];
            unordered_set<int> set;
            for (int j = i + 1; j < nums.size();) {
                if (set.count(target_sum - nums[j])) {
                    vector<int> inner (3);
                    inner[0] = nums[i];
                    inner[1] = nums[j];
                    inner[2] = target_sum - nums[j];
                    res.push_back(inner);
                    j++;
                    while (j < nums.size() && nums[j] == nums[j-1])////<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<
                        j++;
                    continue;
                }
                set.insert(nums[j]);
                j++;
            }
        }
        return res;
    }
};

25. https://leetcode.com/problems/3sum-closest/

How do you calculate the distance between target and sum? Note that, both can be positive and negative.

When doing this, I made it overly complicated, and created a separte function for this. But, it should be abs(target - sum). Think about it. It will work for both positive and negative.

Now how would you implement this?

What I thought was, I would use two pointer approach. I will keep track of the last diff. In two pointer iteration, I would minimize the diff. If we see that diff is increasing compared to previous diff, we should break. This is not right. If diff increases, you should not break because you can still find a smaller diff. Then what's the point of using two pointers? The main benefit is, if we find a diff 0, we can immediately stop.

I also was thinking about 3 nested loop, because I though the inner loop will stop pretty soon. This is not the right approach either. First of all, this is O(n^3). Two pointer approach make the same problem O(n^2)

26. https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-connected-components-in-an-undirected-graph/

Do you implemement using DFS or BFS? I think, both solution works. But, text books are other solutions uses DFS instead of BFS. I didn't find a good explanation why. At first, I though DFS would be better because we don't really iterate all the edges. As DFS goes to depth first, it will find the solution sooner. But, this is not the case. Both DFS and BFS is O(E + V). DFS will eventually check all the edges of the nodes along the way (if the node isn't already visited). So, I think, there is a chance that DFS would be better, but it's not certain.

Also, how would you create adjacency list here?

I am inclind to think that, here I can create it as:

        for (auto &e : edges) {
            adj_list[e[0]].push_back(e[1]);
        } 
As I am primarily interested to mark all the nodes, so I don't really consider opposite direction of the edge. This however will not work in all the cases. We don't know which we will be visiting the nodes. So, correct answer should be: 
        
        for (auto &e : edges) {
            adj_list[e[0]].push_back(e[1]);
            adj_list[e[1]].push_back(e[0]);
        }
        
        
27. https://leetcode.com/problems/delete-node-in-a-linked-list/

28. Try to remember if you can implement in-order, pre-order, post-order travarsal without recursion.

30. https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock/

How would you implement this?

I generally think that, I will find a min to the left and max to the right. Then I will increase the min until I find a lower min. I usually do this because I treat loop as stateless loop. But, we can add state in a loop and do wonderful things. Try to find out if we can have multiple states so that we can find it in one iteration. If you can't, look at the leetcode solution.

31. How to implement heap? priority queue. How to implement max heap? This is simply:

priority_queue<int> q;
p.top()//Note this is not p.front()

For min heap, it should be:

priority_queue<int, vector<int>, greater<int>> pq;//yes, greater<int>, not 'greater' or 'less'. You also need to add vector<int>  

Also, note that priority queue can have size as: pq.size() 

Note that, we generally don't create a heap of size n (I sometimes think of this). We create an empty heap and then add/delete elements to it.

Also, pushing in priority queue is:

pq.push(elem);///<<<Not pq.insert (). Sometimes I mistakenly think so

32. https://leetcode.com/problems/validate-binary-search-tree/

How would you implement this? It may look simple on the surface, but note that all the nodes in left subtree has to be smaller. Try to find the solution. Look at my solution if you can't find.

Here is the soluton.

class Solution {
    bool isValidBST_inner(TreeNode* root, long min, long max) {//<<<<<<<<<<<<
        if (!root)
            return true;
        if (root->left && root->left->val >= root->val)
            return false;
        if (root->right && root->right->val <= root->val)
            return false;
        
        if (root->val >= max || root->val <= min)
            return false;
        
        return isValidBST_inner(root->left, min, root->val) && 
               isValidBST_inner(root->right, root->val, max);        
    }
public:
    bool isValidBST(TreeNode* root) {
        return isValidBST_inner(root, (long)INT_MIN * 2, (long)INT_MAX * 2);//<<<<<<<<<<<<
    }
};

Note that the pointers. You can actually avoid it by passing node pointer instead of the value (as leetcode solution suggests)

Note that, this problem can be solved using in-order travarsal. If you do in-order travarsal, the nodes will be visited in sorted order. Implementing in-order in recursive manner is easy, but implementing it in iterative manner isn't easy. Here. we are implementing it using recursive in-order.

class Solution {
    
    bool isValidBST_inner(TreeNode* root, TreeNode* &prev) {
        bool ret;
        
        if (!root)h?
            return true;
        ret = isValidBST_inner(root->left, prev);
        if (!ret)
            return false;
        if (prev && root->val <= prev->val)
            return false;
        prev = root;
        ret = isValidBST_inner(root->right, prev);
        if (!ret)
            return false;
        return true;
    }

public:
    bool isValidBST(TreeNode* root) {
        TreeNode* prev = nullptr;
        return isValidBST_inner(root, prev);///<<<<<<
    }
};

Note that, if you try to pass a default value at the pointer, the program will be error prone. Passing pointer is less error prone.


33. https://leetcode.com/problems/search-in-rotated-sorted-array/

How would you implement this? What I try to do is do binary search. During binary search, I try to increase/decrase the mid based on which part I'm in. I found it extreamly difficult to solve although leetcode solution 2 use the same approach. Easier approach is to use binary search to find the smallest element. Then do two separate binary search on two parts.

How would you find the smallest element using binary search? To solve this problem (like stock buy sell problem), draw the points as following:

Suppose, you want to implemenmt Kruskal's algorithm. How would you implement it?

How would you check cycle in it? DFS? I sometimes think that I can keep track of visit[] for each point. Can I use that to detect cycle?

You can't. Think of the following:

A     C
|     |
|     |
B     D

All the points are visited, but you can still add edge between A and C. 

So, detecting cycle in graph using DFS is expensive. You can use the above intuition to implement disjoint set data structure.

How would you implement disjoint set?

One option is to have a vector<unordered_set<int>>. This is expesive. How would you merge disjoint sets? We need a data structure that supports that.

class DisjointSet {
    vector<int> parent;
public:    
    DisjointSet (int n) {
        parent = vector<int>(n);//<<<<<<< See how we are creating a vector dynamically for member variable
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
            parent[i] = i;
    }
    
    int find (int n) {//<<<< find
        while (n != parent[n]) {
            n = parent[n];
        }
        return n;
    }
    
    bool merge (int a, int b) {//<<<< Merge
        int p1 = find (a);
        int p2 = find (b);
        
        if (p1 == p2)
            return false;
        parent[p1] = p2;
        return true;
    }
};

The total solution is:

How would you implement this? Note that, sometimes it's OK to create a dummy pointer (ListNode dummyNode), just to avoid complicated check;

39. https://leetcode.com/problems/all-paths-from-source-to-target/

How would you implement it? Note that, you need to implement backtracking in DFS. It is easier to implement backtacking DFS in recursive manner instead of iteratve manner.

40. https://leetcode.com/problems/powx-n/

How would you implememnt this?

I generally do: pow (x, n/2) * pow (x, n - n/2). But, note that, you are calling almost similar function twice. This will result in TLE. You can rather do:

            res = myPow(x, n/2);
            res = res * res;
            if (n & 1)
                res *= x;
                
Also, note that, if n is negative, you need to do n = -n. This will however cause overflow for the largest negative integer. To solve this problem, do following:

        long N = n;
        bool neg = n < 0;

        if (neg)
            N = -N;                

41. https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-integer/

How to solve this? I generally solve as:

https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-integer/

class Solution {
public:
    int reverse(int x) {
        unsigned int X = x < 0 ? -x : x;//<<<<<<Can it cause overflow? Ypu would think No, because it's unsigned. But it will overflow. Use abs() to achive this

        unsigned int num = 0;
        while (X) {
            num = num * 10 + X % 10;//<<<<<<Can it cause overflow? Yes. I usually solve this uinng "long" or "long long", but we cannot use 64 bit int here. 
            X = X/10;
        }

        return x < 0 ? -num : num;
    }
};

Note that, not being able to use 64 bit int is the main challenge here. We need to implement in a way that it can detect overflow. Now, we need to detect overflow before it actually happens. Because if overflow happens, you cannot detect it. So, we can use following approach:

class Solution {
public:
    int reverse(int x) {
        bool neg = x < 0;
        unsigned int X = abs(x);///<<< Don't do -x. It will cause overflow

        unsigned int num = 0;
        while (X) {
            if (!neg && (num > INT_MAX/10 || (num == INT_MAX/10 && X % 10 > 7))) {///<<<<<See how we are avoiding overflow for positive #
                return 0;
            }
            if (neg && (num > INT_MAX/10 || (num == INT_MAX/10 && X % 10 > 8))) {///<<<<<See how we are avoiding overflow for negative #
                return 0;
            }
            num = num * 10 + X % 10;
            X = X/10;
        }

        return neg ? -num : num;
    }
};  

42. https://leetcode.com/problems/lru-cache/

How would you implememnt this? 

I tend to use hash and heap. I also though about using hash and queue. But, if you think carefully, they will not work. But, note that, you can implment using hash + linked list where hash points to the linked list nodes. Everytime you access a node, that node will be pushed to the head. When we delete a node, we will be delete from tail. Which linked list should you use? should you use std::list?

I found that moving around items can be difficult in std::list. So, avoid it. Implement your own list unless what you are doing something trivial like push_back(), pop_back(), push_front(), pop_front(). Note that, std::list has those functions. Although list has splice() that allows you to insert one list into another, it's hard to use if you want to reorder nodes in a list using it. Probably, this is why so mamy leetcode C++ questions still use manual linked list.

Now, would you use single linked list or double linked list? Note that, here double linked list will result in O(1) reoorder (although Single linked list also can have tail)

When implementing linked list of your own, don't forget to do these:

class Node {
public:
    int key;
    int val;
    Node *next;
    Node *prev;
    Node(int k, int v) {
        key = k;
        val = v;
        next = nullptr;//<<<<<<<<I usually forget this
        prev = nullptr;//<<<<<<<<I usually forget this
    }
};

Also, remember that hash has size() function that can give us the size. Hash also has following way to delete a key:

hash.erase(key_to_del);//<<<<You don't need to pass an iterator

43. https://leetcode.com/problems/lfu-cache/

How would you implememt this? 

I think of implememting as hash + priority_queue. Here, priority_queue will contain the nodes (with frequency) and hash points to the node. This however will not work. Because, in C++ priority_queue, you only get top and you can only do push() which will add the item to the bottom of the tree. But, in this case, we may need to update the frequency of an intermediate node. If you do that, priority_queue acts abnormally. To solve this, we can implement our own heap.

Now, even though we don't use heap, let's take a how the heap code would look like:

struct Elem {//<<<<<<<Note that stuct/class name should begin with capital letter.
    int key;
    int val;
    int freq;
    Elem(int k, int v, int f) {//<<<<<<<<<<<<You can add constructor in struct like a class
        key = k;
        val = v;
        freq = f;
    }
};

unordered_map<int, Elem *> hash;//<<<<<Notde that, you don't need struct keyword for struct
Elem *new_elem = new Elem(key, value, 1);//You can also create a struct onbject like a class

//<<<<<Note how functor is written
struct Comp{
    bool operator()(Elem *e1, Elem *e2){//<<< Note that there are two "()". You also need to return true
        return e1->freq < e2->freq;
    }
};

priority_queue<Elem *, vector<Elem *>, Comp> pq;//<<<<<For custom object, we need to give less/greater than function. Here, we need to provide a functor
               
Now, even though you could implement your own heap, that will require you update multiple elements in every iteration. Can you do better?

Yes, you can have a hash<frequency, nodelist>. Here, you will keep all the nodes that have the same frequency in the same bucket. When you update the frequency, you simply need to move the node from current bucket to new bucket. You may think that, here we need linear search to find the node. But, actually you don't. Note that, each node is allocated dynamically. Here, we simply keep the pointer to the node, not the actual node. So, this frequncy hash and key hash will point to the same node. You can move nodes easily around.

You so you need to two hash, right? One keep track of <key, Node*>, another <freq, node>. But, note that, in case of <freq, node>, you sometimes need to find the smallest frequncy? How can you do that. Use map!!!! Remember that map is an ordered_map (internally a red black tree). So, you can easily find the smallest freq as:

map.begin()..

Now, in the requirment it also says that, if there are multiple LFU element, evict the LRU element. So, you need to keep track of the LRU as well. So, solve this problem, we always insert at the end of the list and evict from the head of the list. To implemement that efficiently, we need both head and tail. So, this is the actual implementation:

/*

    int key;

    }

44. How would you implement a unorded_map<pair<int, int>, bool>? Note that, this will not work because it does not know how to use pair<int, int> as key (it doesn't know how to hash it). So, you need to provide your own hash function.  Note that, in  43, we defined priority_queue with custom object. There we implemented () oprator in Cmp. There we passed two Elements of priority queue and we compared them. But, here, we just need to pass one element of the hash and calculate the hash as following.

struct HashFunc {//<<<This can be a struct and define it outside of the class
    int operator()(const pair<int, int> &p) const {//<<<<You only need to pass the key as reference. 
                                                   //<<<<The return value is int. parameter and function, both has to be cosnt. Otherwise, you will get compilatio  error.
        return  p.first * p.second % 100;//<<<Define a hash function any way you like 
    }    
};

class Solution {
public:
    string fractionToDecimal(int numerator, int denominator) {
        string res;
        unordered_map<pair<int, int>, string, HashFunc> hash;//<<<Here you need to pass the hashfunc as third argument
}        
        
Howwould you use hashset instead? I often forget this.

It would be like:

unordered_set<int> hs;//<<<Not "hash_set" or "hashset"
hs.insert(5);//<<<<<<Not hs.push_back(5);

if (hs.count(5))//<<< this  is how we lookup.

We can also use find() in the same way as hash.
              
45. From Dr. Nesterenko's slide, you can append strings in two ways:

string s = "Hello";

s = s + " world";
s.append(" world");

Both are fine. Don't worry about creating stringbuffer.

Also, note that std::string doesn't have strcpy(). For instance, this will not compile:

tmp.strcpy(s, i, s_idx);

So, if you need to copy part of the string to another string, use "+".

Also note that, Following is not allowed!!!! (I often try this). Dr. Nesterenko's slide mentioned this
s = "Hello" + " world";//<<< You cannot apply "+" operartor on "Hello"

You also cannot do:

string s = 'a';


Also, how would you create a string of size 9?

string s(9)//<<<<Not right. This will work for vector, not for string.

Do this:

string s;
s.resize(9);

In most of time, create an empty string with "string s;". And then append to it.

How to earse part of the string?

tmp.erase(tmp_idx);//<<< Erase everything from tmp_idx to the end.
s.erase(0, num_spaces);//<<<It will erase num_spaces spaces from index 0


Sometimes, to erase one character, I write code like://<<<<<<<<<

s.erase(i);//<<<<<<This will erase everything from index i to end!!!!!!!, so don't do that, unless that's what you want


How to create substring? This is often used;

string sub = s.substr(offset, len);
string sub = s.substr(offset);//<<<In this case, it will return everything from the offset


How to convert string to number?

int a = atoi(s.c_str());


How would you search a char or string within a string? From Dr. Nesterenko's slide, you can do:

pos = s.find('.');//<<<This will find from the beginning
pos = s.find('.', start);//<<<This will start from index 'start'

if (pos == string::npos)//<<<not that, this is string::npos, not s::npos. What is string::npos. This is actaully a static const int whose value is -1.
  cout << "The string was not found";
  
I sometimes mistakely think that we can use substr() to find substr. Note the difference between substr() and find().!!!!////<<<<<<<<<<<<  
  
If you want to search multuple times in a string for example in https://leetcode.com/problems/compare-version-numbers/.

You can always start from "pos + 1". But, when you reach string::npos, adding 1 will make it start searching from the beginning. So, idea is if you reach the end, you should start looking from index = length_of_the_string. For instance, this is the solution of the above problem:

    int compareVersion(string version1, string version2) {
        int pos1 = 0, pos2 = 0, start1 = 0, start2 = 0;
        int rev1, rev2;
        
        do {
            pos1 = version1.find('.', start1);
            pos2 = version2.find('.', start2);
            
            if (pos1 == string::npos) {
                rev1 = atoi(version1.substr(start1).c_str());
            } else {
                rev1 = atoi(version1.substr(start1, pos1 - start1 + 1).c_str());
            }
            
            if (pos2 == string::npos) {
                rev2 = atoi(version2.substr(start2).c_str());
            } else {
                rev2 = atoi(version2.substr(start2, pos2 - start2 + 1).c_str());
            }
            
            if (rev1 < rev2)
                return  -1;
            else if (rev1 > rev2)
                return 1;
            if (pos1 != string::npos)
                start1 = pos1 + 1;
            else
                start1 = version1.length();//<<<<If you reach end, start past the last character. Even starting from the last character will have wrong result
            if (pos2 != string::npos)
                start2 = pos2 + 1;
            else
                start2 = version2.length();
        } while (pos1 != string::npos || pos2 != string::npos);
        
        return 0;
    }
};  


Can you do this?

    stack<string> s1;
    s1.push('a');
    
 No. you cannot do that.
 
 You also cannot do:
    s1.push("" + 'a');
    
You need to do:
   string tmp;
   tmp += 'a';
   s1.push(tmp); 
   
Following will not also work:
   string tmp = "" + 'a';
   s1.push(tmp); 

How to insert one string to the beginning of another string?
   
     s.insert(0, "hello");//<<<Note here we need to set the index, not the iterator
     
Following will not work, but sometimes I mistakenly try it:     
     s.insert(s.begin(), "hello");
     
Also, you cannot insert a character into a string. You need to convert the character to string before inserting  
     chat c = 'a';
     s.insert (0, c);//<<<<This doesn't work!!!!!! 
     
Anytime, you need to insert a character at the beginning, do:

s.insert(0, "A");////<<<<<<<<<<<<<< I often forget this. I also do: s.insert("A", 0)

47. How to check if number is a digit or alpha or alphanumeric? How to check if a character is upper or lower?

isahpha()
isdigit()
isalnum()//<<<This is not isalphanum().
islower()
isupper()
ispunct()
isspace()
tolower()
toupper()

How would you check if a string is a number? Note that there is no isnum(), or isnumber() or isnumeric() even though there is isalnum().

You can do this to check if a string is a number;

if (isdigit(s[0])) ///<<<< But this will not work for negative number.

So, right solution is do:

if (isdigit(s[s.length() - 1])) 

The functions are taken from Dr. Nesterenko's example.

50. https://leetcode.com/problems/search-a-2d-matrix-ii

How would you solve this?

I tend to use BFS. But, can you do better? Remember, if you need to do some sort of search, and the numbers are sorted, you can do better => Bibary search.

How would implement binary search here? This is not very clean. Pretty messy. Can you do better?

How about do DFS from top-right or bottom left? What is the benefit? Search space is shrinked. If we start from top-left and bottom-right, search space is huge, because both in creasing or descreasing. If you start from top-right, you only need to visit either left or down. Note that, you don't really need DFS here.

51. How would you define 2D array?

int arr[4][2] = {{0, 1}, {1, 0}, {-1, 0}, {0, -1}};//<<<<<<


Not:

int arr[][] = {{0, 1}, {1, 0}, {-1, 0}, {0, -1}};
int arr[4][] = {{0, 1}, {1, 0}, {-1, 0}, {0, -1}};
int arr[][2] = {{0, 1}, {1, 0}, {-1, 0}, {0, -1}};

52. https://leetcode.com/problems/evaluate-reverse-polish-notation/ 

Here, you need to implement something like:

    int eval (char ch, int a, int b) {
        switch(ch) {
            case '+': return a + b;
            case '-': return a - b;
            case '*': return a * b;
            case '/': return a / b;
        }
        return 0;
    }

What's wrong with this? Even though the final result of the problem is an integer, there is no guarntee that intermediate nuumbers are. So, it can overflow. Anytime you do "+" or "*", think if you need to store in a long instead of int as:

    long eval (char ch, long a, long b) {
        switch(ch) {
            case '+': return a + b;
            case '-': return a - b;
            case '*': return a * b;
            case '/': return a / b;
        }
        return 0;
    }

52. https://leetcode.com/problems/minesweeper/

I had hard time understanding the requirement. Most important part is:

If a cell is unrevealed, and at least one of it's neighbor is revealed, just count how many mines are there around the cell (revealed or unreaveal mines). Then replace the cell with that number.

If a cell is unrevealed and all it's neighbors are unrevealed, the recursively unreveal the neighbors.


53. How would define a Trie node?

struct Node {
//  char ch;//<<<<Note that, in trie, edge represents the value. So, you don't really need this. I often mistakenly add this. Don't do it
  unordered_map<char, Node *> child;//<<< You can have a hash instead of array 
  bool isLeaf;
  Node(char c) {
//      ch = c;
      isLeaf = false;
  }  
};

54. https://leetcode.com/problems/top-k-frequent-elements/ 

How would you implement this?

Note that, heap is a magical data structure. You can throw number number to it and then extract numbers in greater/smaller order without sorting.

Now, remember https://leetcode.com/problems/lfu-cache/

Can you use heap there as well?

No, there we needed to modify the count on the fly. Heap is not good for that (unless you create your own heap). In order to use heap, we have to have frequency of the element readily avaialable like https://leetcode.com/problems/top-k-frequent-elements/

Now, look at the following implementation. What's wrong with this? What is the runtime of the program?

struct Cmp {
    bool operator()(pair<int, int> &p1, pair<int, int> &p2) {
        return p1.second < p2.second;
    }    
};

class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> topKFrequent(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
        unordered_map<int, int> hash;
        priority_queue<pair<int, int>, vector<pair<int, int>>, Cmp> pq;
        vector<int> res(k);
        
        for (auto e : nums)
            hash[e]++;
        
        for (auto &e : hash) {
            pq.push(e);
        }
        
        for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
            res[i] = pq.top().first;
            pq.pop();
        }
        
        return res;
    }
};

Note that, we are creating a heap of size n. If we do that, cost of constructing the heap would be nlogn. So, no benefit. In order for the heap to be effective, the heap size should be k. Look at the code:

struct Cmp {
    bool operator()(pair<int, int> &p1, pair<int, int> &p2) {
        return p1.second > p2.second;
    }    
};

class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> topKFrequent(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
        unordered_map<int, int> hash;
        priority_queue<pair<int, int>, vector<pair<int, int>>, Cmp> pq;
        vector<int> res(k);
        
        for (auto e : nums)
            hash[e]++;
        
        for (auto &e : hash) {
            pq.push(e);
            if (pq.size() > k)//<<<<We don't really need the heap larger than k. So, when it reaches the limit, keep dropping from it. Also not that, in this case, we need min heap, not max heap!!!
                pq.pop();
        }
        
        for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
            res[i] = pq.top().first;
            pq.pop();
        }
        
        return res;
    }
};

What's the time complexity? O (nlogk)

55. https://leetcode.com/problems/find-median-from-data-stream/

Here, you will need a min and max heap? What will be the condition of Cmp for min and max?

It would be:

struct CmpMin {
    bool operator()(int a, int b) {
        return a > b;
    }    
};

struct CmpMax {
    bool operator()(int a, int b) {
        return a < b;
    }    
};

class MedianFinder {
    priority_queue<int, vector<int>, CmpMin> pqmin;//<<<Note for min, we need to cheak greater (the opposite)
    priority_queue<int, vector<int>, CmpMax> pqmax;//<<<For max, we need to check smaller (the opposite)

56. https://leetcode.com/problems/design-twitter/

Here, it can be tempting to implememt tweets as:

unordered_map<int, list<pair<int, int>>> tweets;

This is because to find most recent 10 tweets, we need to access tweets like a linked list (get next node from current node). How would you implement the priority_queue then? 

I think that I would implement it as:

        priority_queue<pair<int, int>::iterator, vector<pair<int, int>::iterator>, Cmp> pq;
        
Problem with this approach is how would you if the iterator has reach the end?

You also need to store the person's id in the node so that you can get the list. Another approach would be not to use list. Implement your own Linkedlist. This is actaully better.

57. https://leetcode.com/problems/subsets/

How would you implemement this? 

Note that, if you keep another vector to keep track, that's not right (will get TLE); why? In backtarcaking, if you have a same node again, you should use memorization. For this, you should use each state a vector. This is how we can implement it.

struct HashFunc {
    int operator()(const vector<int> &v) const {//<<<See we can use vector as a key. Don't forget the const, otherwise it will not work. Also don't forget the reference. Otherwise it will not work. I often forget those
        long long sum = 0;
        
        for (auto e : v)
            sum += e;
        return sum;
    }    
};

class Solution {
    void subsets_inner(vector<int>& nums, 
                       unordered_set<vector<int>, HashFunc> &us, vector<vector<int>> &res) {
        int n = nums.size();
        
        if (us.count(nums))
            return;
        
        res.push_back(nums);
        us.insert(nums);
        
        if (n == 1)
            return;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            int tmp = nums[i];
            nums.erase(nums.begin() + i);
            subsets_inner(nums, us, res);
            nums.insert(nums.begin() + i, tmp);//<<<This is how you can insert inside a vector
        }
    }

    vector<vector<int>> subsets(vector<int>& nums) {
        int n = nums.size();

In deque, you add/delete from both front and back. In queue, you cannot delete from back. Note that, in queue, you have back() to access the back. But, you cannot delete it.

    }  
};
unordered_set<pair<int, int>, HashFunc> visit;        

Better approach would be:


struct HashFunc {

        return abs((p.first * p.second)) % 10000000;//<<< The keys are more spreadout

61. https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-knight-moves/

How would you implement this? 

Note that, there is a contstraint. How would you use that?

I tend to use BFS. If the any nodes we visit exceeds the constrants, I prune those nodes. But, it's not right. Search can go outside of the constrained space, but come back to map properly.

Will BFS scale? 

No.. I then also tend to consider A* search given my previous experience. But, can you do better? Bi-directional search!!!! Use bideirectional search instead of A* all the time!!! More intuitive.

I then implemented bi-direcrectional search. But, I was getting TLE. Then I realized that I was doing BFS less efficieently. In BFS, I add a node. Then in queue, I extract a node from the queue. I check if it's visited. If it's already visited, then continue. Otherwise, mark it visited. And then expand all the edges of the node by adding them to the queue. We can make it little more efficienet by checking if the new adjacent node is already visited. If it's not aready visited, then add it to the queue.

But, we can actually make BFS more efficient. When add the first node to the queue, also mark it visited before entering into the loop. In the loop, you simply extract the node, process it. Then add all the adjacent nodes to the queue if they are not already visited. Note that, when we are adding a node to the queue, we immemdiately mark it visited. So, we don't need to check if it's visited inside the top of the loop. The bidirectional search code is as follows:

struct Node {
    int x;
    int y;
    int level;
    Node (int x_, int y_, int level_) {
        x = x_;
        y = y_;
        level = level_;
    }
};

        return abs((p.first * p.second)) % 10000;
    }

            }
        }
        return 0;
    }
}; 


Also, note how we implement bidirectional search. In every ieration, we need to check if the current node exists in other set. Sometimes, I mistakenly write a loop on all the nodes of a visit hash and check if any of the element exists in the other group. This is very unefficient and unnecessary.


Also note that, instead of using pair<int, int> as key, we can use string as a key (e.g. "0, 1"). That certainly makes code cleaner because you don't need to create custom hash. I thought I would get better performance with that. But, after trying, I didn't see performance improvement over pair<int, int>.

How would you implememt this?

In sliding window, I tend to think that, when we find a unmatch, we need to move start all the way to past end. But, that's not right. If we don't find a match, we should increase start one step only (if needed, look at my solution below). 

Also, when sliding window shoud stop? 

It should go until (end < size).

Here, in each iteration, check the end. If we find a match, then increase the end. Otherwise increase the start.

How would you solve this?

Note that, it's easy to confuse backtracking with DP. DP is also a combinatorial optimization prolem. Sometimes, I wrongly think that the main difference between the two is that DP is an optimizaion problem whearas backtracking is not. But, that is not true. DP doesn't necessarily have to be optimization problem. For instance, counting all possible combination can also be DP. We will see soon. 

If a problem is a potential DP, try implementing in a bottom-up fashion. That leads to the solution usually.


DP can be only be applied if following two rules hold (typically you don't need to consider these while solving a problem): 

Overlapping subproblem
Principle of optimality - local oprtimal leads to gloabal optimal.


https://leetcode.com/problems/coin-change-ii/

How would you implement this?

Will backtacking work? Note that, in backtracking will produce same result multiple times. For intsance, if coins = {1, 2, 5} and amount = 6. In backtracking, it will produce
{1, 1, 1, 1, 2}, {1, 1, 1, 2, 1},... Problem is the are the same. So, backtracking doesn't work if multiple solution with different order actaully mean the same solution. One way to solve this is to store the result and check if a result is already added. However, this can be a very expensive solution because you need to sort the result before checking. Can you do better?

Yes, this is also a DP. This is an example of DP which is not an optimization problem.

How would you formulate it in bottom-up fashion? Note that, if you do bottom up on amount, it will not work because it will include same solution multiple times? How about bottom-up on coin array. Add one coin at a time.

Try formulatimng the DP. I found it really hard!!!

65. https://leetcode.com/problems/max-stack/

How would you implement this?

One approach can be delayed delete. Another approach can be balanced binary tree (both are mentioned in the leetcode solution). 

Balanced binary tree (e.g. red-black tree) is a good solution if you want to keep elements in sorted order. It allows us log(n) lookup. Insert and delete is also log(n) + balancing cost(fixed).

We can implement balanced tree using map. This is how to use map:

int main()
{
    // Ordered map
    std::map<int, int> order;
 
    // Mapping values to keys
    order[5] = 10;
    order[3] = 5;
    order[20] = 100;
    order[1] = 1;
 
    // Iterating the map and
    // printing ordered values
    for (auto i = order.begin(); i
         != order.end(); i++) {
        std::cout << i->first
                  << " : "
                  << i->second << '\n';
    }
}

Output:

1 : 1
3 : 5
5 : 10
20 : 100

//<<<<<Note that keys are kept sorted.

If you need the largest key, you can access by map.rbegin()

How to delete elements in map?

int main ()
{
  std::map<char,int> mymap;
  std::map<char,int>::iterator it;

  // insert some values:
  mymap['a']=10;
  mymap['b']=20;
  mymap['c']=30;
  mymap['d']=40;
  mymap['e']=50;
  mymap['f']=60;

  it=mymap.find('b');
  mymap.erase (it);                   //<<<< You can erase by iterator

  mymap.erase ('c');                  //<<<<< You can erase by key

  it=mymap.find ('e');
  mymap.erase ( it, mymap.end() );    //<<<< You can erase by range

  // show content:
  for (it=mymap.begin(); it!=mymap.end(); ++it)
    std::cout << it->first << " => " << it->second << '\n';

  return 0;
}

Note that, keys of map are unique. You cannot have same key with mutiple times. If you need same key twice, you will need multimap which is similar to map. Example taken from Dr. Nesterenko's example:

int main () {

How would you implement this?

I typically sort this. Then merge one left half and right half. If you do that, you will not get right result. For instance, for [4, 5, 5, 6], result would be [4, 5, 5, 6] which is not right. Right result would be [5, 6, 5, 5]. How can you achieve that output?

I tried to find a different algorithm, but couldn't find. But, note that you have following situation:

               C
     B    B

A 

To make it to work, you need to make it to:


     C
B              B

         A
         
So, acoording to that, my solution was:

class Solution {
public:
    void wiggleSort(vector<int>& nums) {
        int n = nums.size(), secord_part_size = n/2;
        vector<int> res(n);
        
        sort(nums.begin(), nums.end());
        for (int i = 0, j = n - secord_part_size, k = 0; k < n; i++, j++) {
            res[k++] = nums[i];
            if (k < n)
                res[k++] = nums[j];
        }

        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            if (res[i] == res[i-1]) {//<<<Rearranging if two consecutive elements are the same.
                int a1 = res[i-2];
                int a2 = res[i];
                int a3 = res[i+1];
                res[i-2] = a2;
                res[i-1] = a3;
                res[i] = a1;
                res[i+1] = a2;
                i = 0;///After doing it, start over because doing so can cause create the same problem elsewhere
            }
        }

        nums = res;
    }
};

How would you solve this?

I know that this is Matrix chain multiplication problem. But, I don't remember how the problem is solved. I can view this as a typical combinatorial optimization problem. So, I may think that I will consider only one operator first. Then only 2 operators, then only 3 operators....finally all the operrators. So, I can build a DP array like:

--------------------
|  A  |   B  |  C  |
...................-
|     |   B  |  C  |
--------------------
|     |      |  C  |
--------------------

Here, I need to calculate the elements diagonally. I mistakenly implement in row/column-wise travarsal which gives me wrong result.

I also make another big mistake. I calculate dp[i][j] based on dp[i][j-1] and dp[i+1][j]. But, it will not work. This will skip lots of possible solution space. Why? It means, for intsance, you are calculating dp[0][5] based on dp[0][4] and dp[1][4]. But, there are many other ways you can break dp[0][4]. 

For instance, you can calculate [0, 4] based on:

1. [0,0] [1,4]
2. [0,1] [2,4]
3. [0,2] [3,4]
4. [0,3] [4,4]

So, Yes, matrix chanin multiplication problem as a combinatorial optimization problem, but, you cannot simply calculate it based on dp[i][j-1] and dp[i+1][j]. For each entry, you need an inner loop to check all possible ways to break the range. Now, how would you implement this?

If you try to implemement an inner loop, you will see another problem. If you try to break by operator, you one operand will be in both part. So, you can't really btreak by operator. 
You need to break by operand. So, formulate using operand as before. Note that, you will need an inner loop. The code looks like:

int eval (int a, char op, int b) {
  return (op == '+') ? a + b : a * b;
}

int max_value(string s) {
  vector<int> operands;
  vector<char> operators;
  
  for (int i = 0, start = 0; i < s.length(); i++) {//<<<Parsing string into numbers and operators. Note that parsing string is not difficult at all
    if (!isdigit(s[i])) {
      operands.push_back(atoi(s.substr(start, i - start).c_str()));
      operators.push_back(s[i]);
      start = i + 1;
    } else if (i == s.length() - 1) {
      operands.push_back(atoi(s.substr(start).c_str()));
    }
  }
  
  int n = operands.size();
  vector<vector<int>> dp(n);
  
  for (auto &e : dp)
    e.resize(n);

    
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {//<<<<<Initialize the diagonal as the operand
    dp[i][i] = operands[i];
  }
  
  for (int m = 1; m < n; m++) {//<<<<Iterarate over each diagonal
    for (int i = 0, j = m; j < n; i++, j++) {//<<<<Iterarate over each diagonal
      dp[i][j] = INT_MIN;
      for (int k = i, m = i + 1; k < j; k++, m++) {//<<<<Check all possible way to break it
        int e = eval (dp[i][k], operators[k], dp[m][j]);
	dp[i][j] = max(dp[i][j], e);
      }      
    } 
  }   
  
  return dp[0][n-1];
}

Note that, I created the solution without looking into Matrix chanin multiplication solution. Here, I simply tried to formulate the problem in a bottom up manner and it works.

What is the differnece between this problem and https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-subarray/?

Even if we implemented maximum-subarray as 2D DP array (which is unefficient and there is a better way), there we needed to iterate over all possible subset. So, we didn't need the inner loop. On the other hand, in this problem, we needed to break the solution in all possible ways. So, we needed inner loop. I think, this is the essense of matrix chain multiplication problem.


Later, I checked the solution of this problem and matrix chain multiplication problem from geeksforgeeks. They are also using the same approach. So, no need to travarse the array in row/column fashion. Travarse it in diagonal fashion!!!!



70. https://leetcode.com/problems/group-anagrams/

How would you implement this?

Note that, here you can sort the string because strings with different string lengths doesn't need to be checked. How can you sort the array of string based on string length?

        sort(strs.begin(), strs.end(), [](string &s1, string &s2) {
            return s1.length() < s2.length();
        });
      
But, do we really need to sort the string? We can use frequency array as key in a hash:

struct HashFunc {//<<<<<It should be struct. If you declare it as class, it will not work.
    int operator()(const vector<int> &v) const {//<<<Note that we need make it cost for hash. Cost is not needed for writing CmpFunc for priority_queue

            sum += e;
        }
        return sum;
    }    
};

            freq[s[i]-'a']++;
        }
        return freq;
    }

            hash[key].push_back(e);
        }

How would you implement this?

You will think of recursion....Now, think, if you can solve it in a bottom up (DP) manner. You will see that it's possible. Everytime you solve something using recursion, think if you can solve it using bottom-up manner (DP). DP implementation is usually cleaner and less error prone.

Also, note that this is not an optimization problem. This is more like a combinatorial problem, but still DP can be applied.

If you can't figure out the solution, look at my own solution.

72. https://leetcode.com/problems/sort-an-array/

How would implement this?

You can use quick sort or merge sort? How would you implememt both approach?

What is the run time of quick sort?

No, it's not O(nlogn). It's O(n^2). Why? If your pivot is really the smallest element of the the array, it will call quick sort for rest of the element. It will not divide the array into two almost equal part. So, worst case run time for quick sort is O(n^2), but average case run time is O(nlong).

If you want quarnteed O(nlogn), you need to implement merge sort.

But, try to implement this problem in both quick sort and merge sort (although quick sort will get TLE. Note that, you can check if the array is already sorted, and skip it altogether sorting. I tried that with quick sort. It still gets TLE. It's because if the array is mostly sorted, it will also result in poor performance.)

For quick sort, how would you implement partition?

I generally think like this. I will take first element as pivot. Then I would have two index, i = start + 1, j = end. Then I use two pointer approach. Any time, I find two elements one is bigger than pivot and another is smaller than pivot, I sawp them. Then I put the pivot to actual position. So, the implementation looks like:

    void sortArray(vector<int>& nums, int start, int end) {
        int pivot = start, s = start + 1, e = end;
        
        while (e > s) {
            while (s <= e && nums[s] < nums[pivot])
                s++;
            while (e >= s && nums[e] > nums[pivot]) {
                e--;
            }
            
            if (e > s) {
                swap(nums[s++], nums[e--]);
            }
        }
        swap(nums[pivot], nums[s]);
        sortArray (nums, start, s - 1);
        sortArray (nums, s + 1, end);
    }

But, this will not work. //<<<<<<<<This is not the right way to implement two pointer approach. In two pointer, we should only update start/end only once in each iteration.

I saw different ways to implememt partuition. They both use one and two pointer approach. For instance, this is a one pointer approach to do partition:

https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/quick-sort/

Based on the concept, I implememented, my own one pointer approach to partition, but it gets TLE. It's as following:

    void sortArray(vector<int>& nums, int start, int end) {
        int pivot_idx = start, idx_to_replace = start;
        
        if (end - start + 1 == 2) {
            if (nums[end] < nums[start]) {
                swap (nums[end], nums[start]);
            }
            return;
        }
        
        if (end - start + 1 < 2)
            return;
        
        for (int i = start + 1; i <= end; i++) {
            if (nums[i] < nums[pivot_idx]) {
                swap (nums[i], nums[idx_to_replace]);
                if (idx_to_replace == pivot_idx) {
                    pivot_idx = i;
                }
                idx_to_replace++;
            }
        }
        swap(nums[idx_to_replace], nums[pivot_idx]);
        sortArray (nums, start, idx_to_replace - 1);
        sortArray (nums, idx_to_replace + 1, end);
    }
    
    
Note that, two pointer is more efficient than than one pointer approach because in one pointer approch, you may need to swap a node to pivot which actually in the right partion anyway, so not needed to be swapped. Two pointer approach actually makes more sense here.

Note that, in two pointer, implement in a way that only low or high index is updated at most once in each iteration.////<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<    

    void sortArray(vector<int>& nums, int start, int end) {
        if (end <= start)
            return;
        int pivot = nums[start];
        int low = start + 1, high = end;
       
        while (low < high) {///<<<<<<< Note, as we update index at a time, when low == high, we can immediately stop.
            if (nums[low] < pivot) {
                low++;
            } else if (nums[high] > pivot) {
                high--;
            } else {
                swap (nums[low], nums[high]);
                low++;
                high--;
            }
        }
        if (nums[low] > pivot)
            low--;
        swap (nums[start], nums[low]);
        sortArray (nums, start, low - 1);
        sortArray (nums, low + 1, end);
    }
    
    
But, as mentioned earlier, quick sort isn't the right solution for this problem.

How would you implemengt merge sort? If you can't remember, look at my own solution.   


72. https://leetcode.com/problems/search-in-rotated-sorted-array/

How would you implement this?

Here, I mistakenlt plot the points as:


         A
       A
    A 
  A
A             
              A
                A
                  A
                  
Actually, the plot should be:

         A
       A
    A 
  A
A         
    
            A
          A
        A 
        
Now, you can see that there are two segments. I still had hard time formulating binary search for it.

If start and end are in one segment, it's like ordinary binary search. But, if start and end span two line segments, then it's complicated. How would you formulate the condition? I tend to only consider mid, and based on that, I try to make a decision. That's wrong. There is another important criteria: target. So, there can be following situation:

mid                    target
-------------------------------------
first part             first part
first part             second part
second part            first part
second part            second part  

Now you can formulate the binary search.

This seems like applying backtracking on both string and check equality in each stage. This seems like extremely complicated alogirithm without DP. But, DP can help us to solve it very easily. Note that, if you encounter similar problem, it's likly to be DP as well.

How would you implement it in DP? In DP, try to solve any problem in bottom up manner. If you can't, try to solve larger problem from smaller problem. I was able to solve it owbn my own without looking at the solution.

76. https://leetcode.com/problems/edit-distance/

How would you implement this? I know that this DP. If I had to implement it other than DP, I had to use backtracking. So, similar problem can be implemented by DP.

How would you formulate it in DP?

Try to solve it in a bottom up fashion or try to solve larger problem from smaller problem. I was able to formulate DP without looking at the solution.  

76. Note that, following will not work.

int arr[] = {3, 4, 4, 6};

It should be:

int arr[4] = {3, 4, 4, 6};

Also, C++ doesn't have exponent operator. So, following would not work:

int a = 2^i;

It should be:

int a = pow (2, i);


77. https://leetcode.com/problems/gray-code/

How would you implement this? If can't figure, look at the leetcode solution and my solution.

78. If you define a constructor in C++, do you still implement deafult constructor to use it?

Yes, if you define a constructor, compiler will no longer provide the deafult constructor. For instance, following will not work:

 Class Test{
    int a;
    int b;
    Test (int a_, int b_) {
      a = a_;
      b = b_;
    }
 }
 
 Test t;//<<<It will invoke deafult constrctor which doen't exist.
 
 Following will work:
 
  Class Test{
    int a;
    int b;
    Test () {//<<<<You need to define default constructor manually
      a = 0;
      b = 0;
    }
    Test (int a_, int b_) {
      a = a_;
      b = b_;
    }
 }
 
 Test t;
 
 
 79. How to append one vector 'b' to vector 'a'? Vector 'a' can be empty or non empty.
 
 a.insert(a.end(), b.begin(), b.end());//<<<This will append 'b' to the end of 'a'. This will work even if 'a' is empty.
 
 80. https://leetcode.com/problems/rectangle-area/
 
 How would you implement this? If you can't figure out, take a look my own solution. There the idea is:
 
 Here, main question is how can you find the points of intersection rectangle?
 
 If a rectangle is like, how would you calculate the intersection point?
 
          ----------------
          |               |
          |               |
 -------------------      |
 |        |        |      |
 |        |        |      |
 |        ---------|-------
 |                 |
 ------------------
 
Bottom left of intersection would be: <max (ax1, bx1), max (ay1, by1)> (take maximum of the lower left)
Top right of intersection would be: <min (ax2, bx2), min (ay2, by2)>  (take minimum of upper left)

Now, will this work for other situation?

I found that the same rule holds if the rectangles are positioned differently. So, we can use the formula.


81. https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-product-subarray/

How would you implement it?

Also, when can you implement combinatorial optimization using to a nested loop?

Think about the following loop.

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            for (int j = i; j < n; j++) {
                cout << "i = " << i << " j = " << j << endl; 
            }
        }
It will produce something like:

--------------------
|  A  |   B  |  C  |
...................-
|     |   B  |  C  |
--------------------
|     |      |  C  |
--------------------

So, you can use the for loop a get all the subset of size 1, 2, 3...n. So, in those cases, you can use for loop for creating subset.

I often try to solve https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-product-subarray/ as follows. But it gets TLE!!!!

class Solution {
public:
    int maxProduct(vector<int>& nums) {
        int res = INT_MIN;
        int n = nums.size();
        int prod;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            prod = nums[i];
            res = max (prod, res);
            for (int j = i + 1; j < n; j++) {
                prod *= nums[j];
                res = max (res, prod);
            }
        }
        
        return res;
    }
};        

Can you do it at O(n)? Then answer is probably you can and the answer would be DP, because this is a combinatorial optumization problem. Note that, the previous solution already looks like a DP bacuse it's creating a 2D array and checking all possible combination. How can you make it O(n) DP?

If you can't figure out, note that, in DP, we calculate the solution in bottom up manner. So, try to visualize how the bottom up solution will look like. Visualize how the final solution can be calculated based on smaller solution. If still can't figure out, look at my own solution.

82. https://leetcode.com/problems/populating-next-right-pointers-in-each-node-ii/

How would you implement this?

At first, I think, I would use recursivly make pointers of childer to chield of children as:

class Solution {
    void connnect_sibling(Node* n1, Node* n2) {
        Node *a, *b;
        
        if (!n1)
            return;
        n1->next = n2;
        
        queue<Node*> q;
        if (n1 && n1->left)
            q.push(n1->left);
        if (n1 && n1->right)
            q.push(n1->right);
        if (n2 && n2->left)
            q.push(n2->left);
        if (n2 && n2->right)
            q.push(n2->right);
        
        while (q.size() > 1) {
            a = q.front(); 
            q.pop();
            b = q.front();
            connnect_sibling (a, b);
        }
    }
public:
    Node* connect(Node* root) {
        if (!root)
            return root;
        connnect_sibling (root->left, root->right);
        return root;
    }
};

But, this will not work!! This is because a child of a node may need to point to children of cousin. The above code will work for pointing to child of of siblings, but not for cousines. Now, how can you implement this?

Level order travarsal...      

83. Suppose, you need to implement vector<pair<index(int), freq(int)>>. You need to sort it. How would you implement that?

Instead of doing that, we can create another array of indices and sort that array based on the freq as:

        vector<int> freq(n);//<<<<Actual frequncy
        vector<int> indices(n);//<<<Create an additional array
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {//<<<<Set the indices
            indices[i] = i;
        } 

        sort(indices.begin(), indices.end(), [&](int a, int b) {//<<<Sort the indices based on the freqency
            return freq[a] <= freq[b];
        });

84. https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-height-trees/

How would you implememt this?

Here, I think of using map<int, int> where each entry contains the frequency. I do this because I want to access the most frequent node first, then next most frequent and so on. So, will this work? 

No!!! map<int, int> keeps key-value pairs sorted on key, not the value!!!!!! Here, I need access element in the order of their frequency. So, what can we do?

We can simply sort them. So, I implemented as the below code. Here, the idea is most frequent node would be the root. But, later we found out that approach will not work. For instance, in the following graph, 3 should be the root, although most frequent node is 0. So, following code will not work.

       0

So, how can we implememt this. I then used brutforce approach and calculate tree-height for each node. We store the node and height in a priority_queue. That approach gets TLE.

What would be the algorithm to find the root for MHT?

85. Sometimes, I need to use queue of pairs. Code as following: it makes it simpler.

        q.push(make_pair(root, 0));
        while (!q.empty()) {
            n = q.front().first;//<<<<Store the first and second to actual variable so that it makes more sense.
            level = q.front().second;//<<<<Store the first and second to actual variable so that it makes more sense.
            q.pop();
            .....
    }
};

For instance, following doesn't work

The solution is to use std::advance().

88. In class, you can define multiple members in the same line:

class ZigzagIterator {
    int idx1, idx2, m, n;//<<<<<<This is perfectly valid
    bool first;
    vector<int> _v1, _v2;//<<<<<<This is perfectly valid
};

89. https://leetcode.com/problems/zigzag-iterator/

How would you store the vector inside your class? Would you define as a refernce or object?

You need to define as object as:

class ZigzagIterator {
    int idx1, idx2, m, n;
    bool first;
    vector<int> _v1, _v2;
public:
    ZigzagIterator(vector<int>& v1, vector<int>& v2) {
        idx1 = 0;
        idx2 = 0;
        m = v1.size();
        n = v2.size();
        first = m > 0;
        _v1 = v1;
        _v2 = v2;
    }
}

Note that, if you define as reference, you will get compilation error. 

Isn't creating multiple copies of the vector expensive?

Here, we are not actually creating a new copy of the vector. _v1 and _v2 will point the actual vector. If you change _v1 or _v2, actual vector will be changed. So, even though we are defineing an object in class, we are not creating separate copies.
The class will need to create a separate copy of the vector

92. https://leetcode.com/problems/detect-cycles-in-2d-grid/

How would you implement this?

DFS. How would you implement DFS?

It seems that I was doing DFS inefficiently. Think about the graph. For instance, you start with A. Then you will visit B for instance. From B, you can visit C or A. How would you prevent from visit A from B? 

  B----C
 /      |
A-------D

YOu will mark A visited. But, that will not work, because at some point in D, you will come accross A again. How would you differentiate if it's cycle or you are just getting back from B?

The trick is, for un-directed graph, you also need to keep track of the node you are visiting from. For instance, when visiting B, you also need to pass that it's coming from A. That way, it will know that, it should not visit A from B.




You start with A. 

93. https://leetcode.com/problems/regular-expression-matching/

How would you solve this problem?

You can implement it using recursion. But, there will be many common sub-problem. So, you can use memorization or DP. So, DP is clearly a good candidate. This problem is lot like edit-distance problem. But the difference is, I knew that edit distance can be solved using DP. But, I didn't know for sure if this problem can be solved using DP.

Now, there are two problems:

1. Is this really a DP?
2. How would you formulate DP?

Let's first assume that it's a DP. That is, I will try to solve the prblem using bottom-up approach. I was able to do that without looking at the solution.

How do you formulate it?

It was not very clear in the beginning. In many problem, I try to visualize how top-down solution works on paper. From there, I can have a hint on how bottom-up solution would look like. Then, I just draw a DP table and see if I can formulate the problem there. If I can, I got it.

            else
                i++;    
        }
This is taken from Dr. Nesterenko's approach.

94. https://leetcode.com/problems/wildcard-matching/

How would you implememt this?

If you think, it's a recursion and likely be a DP problem like edit distance. How can you be sure if it's a DP and how to formulate the DP? 

I was able to solve this without looking at the solution. First. I thought of how top-down approach will work. Then I had an idea how bottom up approach will work. Then I created a DP array and tried to solve the propblem on paper using DP table. If I can formulate on the table, then it's DP problem (no need to think about principle of optimality and overlapping subproblem).

95. https://leetcode.com/problems/course-schedule/

How would you implement this?

I can implement this using checking cycle in DFS. However, implementing DFS can be much trickier sometimes. On the other hand. BFS is generally simple.

For instance, in https://leetcode.com/problems/detect-cycles-in-2d-grid/ I had to implement DFS to detect the cycle in an undirected grapph. There the issue was how to you prevent DFS to go back to the previous node, because it's undirected graph. I carefully used direction there. Based on the direction, I don't go to the node where I came from.

Now, we have a directed graph. So, we don't have that problem. Also, I used to implement DFS like a backtrcking solution where I don't return the result. This is not right. You can actually return the result. I found not retrurning the result is more easy, but it may lead to less readable code. So, return the result instaed as:

class Solution {
    bool is_cycle (int numCourses, vector<vector<int>> &adj_list,
              vector<bool> &visit, vector<bool> &path, int a) {//<<<<<<<<<<
        bool ret = false;
        path[a] = true;
        visit[a] = true;
        
        for (auto &e: adj_list[a]) {
            if (visit[e])
                return true;
            ret = is_cycle(numCourses, adj_list, visit, path, e);
            if (ret)
                break;    
        }
        visit[a] = false;
        return ret;
    }
public:
    bool canFinish(int numCourses, vector<vector<int>>& prerequisites) {
        vector<vector<int>> adj_list(numCourses);
        vector<bool> visit(numCourses, false);
        vector<bool> path(numCourses, false);

        for (auto &e : prerequisites) {
            adj_list[e[1]].push_back(e[0]);
        }

        for (int i = 0; i < numCourses; i++) {
            if (!path[i]) {
                if (is_cycle(numCourses, adj_list, visit, path, i))//<<<<DFS
                    return false;
            }
        }
        return true;
    }
}; 



Now DFS in directed graph has own set of challenges. In DFS, we simply mark a node visited and call DFS on its adjacent nodes. Now, will this work for following graph?

     
   -->b------>C------>d
  /                   ^
 /                    |
/                     |   
a-------------------->e


Here, we will visit a, b, c, d and mark them visited. Then we will visit a, e and d and mistakenly call it cycle. But, it's not a cycle.


To solve this prolem, when we backtracking from a node, we will mark it unvisited again. That way, when it visits a, e , d, it will not result in mistaken cycle. The code will look like:

    bool is_cycle (int numCourses, vector<vector<int>> &adj_list,
              vector<bool> &visit, int a) {
        bool ret = false;
        path[a] = true;//<<<<<<<<<<
        
        for (auto &e: adj_list[a]) {
            if (visit[e])
                return true;
            ret = is_cycle(numCourses, adj_list, visit, path, e);
            if (ret)
                break;    
        }
        visit[a] = false;//<<<<<<<<
        return ret;
    }


Now, this approach has another performance problem. Think about the graph:


      ------------------
      |                |
      |                |
      |                v
a---->b------->c------>d         e
      |        |                ^ ^
      |        |                | |

Here, we will visit a, b, c, d , backtrack, e, backtrack, backtrack, d, backtrack, e  

So, note that we are visiting d and e multiple times unncessarily. This causes TLE. But, if we mark a node unvisited, we have no way of knowing if we visited it before.


So, solution is, don't mark it unvisited when backtrack. Instead mark it as a differet color. When visit node for the first time, mark it as 1. When backtracking from the node, mark it as 2. That way, we can distingush beteen the two situation. The code should look like:

    bool is_cycle (int numCourses, vector<vector<int>> &adj_list,
              vector<int> &visit, int a) {
        bool ret = false;
        visit[a] = 1;  ///<<<<< mark it 1 for the first time
        
        for (auto &e: adj_list[a]) {
            if (visit[e] == 1)//<<<<< It's one, that means we found a cycle because it's still under consideration
                return true;
            if (visit[e] == 2)///<<<<<If the node is 2, that means we already backtracked from the node, so don't need to visit again
                continue;      
            ret = is_cycle(numCourses, adj_list, visit, e);
            if (ret)
                break;   
        }
        visit[a] = 2;////<<<<<When backtracking (done with the node), mark it as 2 (dead)
        return ret;
    }

How would you implement this?

This problem looks an extension of previous problem. We can simple implement a DFS to do that. Now, when in DFS would you add the course?

When we reach at the end, we bracktack. And then we should add the course. Not when we visit a node. So, to find the actual result, we need to reverse it before returning.

Now, think about it. Will it work for this graph?

      ------------------

      -----------------------------     
      
It will work if we start with node a. But, it will not work if we start with node b or c. So, here we cannot start from arbitrary node in DFS. We missed this point in course-schedule problem. There also we cannot start from arbitrary node. That may result wrong result because for instance, if we start with c, c and c, d, e will be visited. So, when we start from a, those nodes (c, d, e) will not be considered which may for cycle. So, in directed grapg in DFS, we need to start from a node with indegree 0. So, the code should look like:

class Solution {
    void dfs (int numCourses, vector<vector<int>> &adj_list,
              vector<int> &visit, int a, vector<int> &res, bool &iscycle) {
        visit[a] = 1;
        for (auto &e: adj_list[a]) {
            if (visit[e] == 1) {
                iscycle = true;
                return;
            }
            if (visit[e] == 2)
                continue;      
            dfs(numCourses, adj_list, visit, e, res, iscycle);
            if (iscycle)
                return;
        }
        visit[a] = 2;
        res.push_back(a);///<<<When backtracking, adding the node to result
    }
public:
    vector<int> findOrder(int numCourses, vector<vector<int>>& prerequisites) {
        vector<int> res;
        vector<vector<int>> adj_list(numCourses);
        vector<int> visit(numCourses);
        vector<int> indegress(numCourses);

        for (auto &e : prerequisites) {
            adj_list[e[1]].push_back(e[0]);
            indegress[e[0]]++;
        }

        for (int i = 0; i < numCourses; i++) {
            if (indegress[i] == 0 && visit[i] == 0) {////<<<<Only start from a node with indegree 0.
                bool iscycle = false;
                dfs(numCourses, adj_list, visit, i, res, iscycle);
                if (iscycle)
                    return vector<int>();
            }
        }
        
        if (res.size() != numCourses)////<<<<Explained below
            return vector<int>();

        reverse(res.begin(), res.end());
        return res;
    }
};


Note that, starting only from 0 indegree node has other consequnces. For instance, think about the graph.

   -->b------>C------>d
  /                   |
 /                    |
/                     v   
a<--------------------e


Here, there is no node with indegree 0. So, these nodes will not be visited at all. That's why, in the solution we check if we visited all the nodes

How would you solve this?

Merge sort..How would you implement merge sort? What would be the base condition of merge sort?

I typically think that, when array size is 2, then we should stop and sort it. But, it can be better. Base condition can be array size = 1. That means, when only one element, then 
return. Merging logic will merge two arrays of size 1. ////<<<<<<<<

How would you implement merging? Would you use in-place merging or allocate extra place?

Let's think about in-place merging first. For instance, we need to merge this:

[1   5   8]   [2 6 7]

In in-place merging, it will work like:

[1  5  7]     [2  6  8] ----> add count of 8 to 3
[1  5  6]     [2  7  8] ----> add count of 7 to 2 /////<<<< But this is wrong. Here, 7 was in right array, then moved to left, and then move to right again. When it moves from left to right, we simply cannot add the count. That will be wrong. 

This is why, in-place merging will not work (to my knowledge) for this problem.

We need to create a temporary array and merge them. Now think again, how would you calculate the count in merging here (with temp array):

A[1  5  7]     B[2  6  8]

One solution can be: any time, a number moves from B to A's position, we can increment count of all the following elements of A. For instance, merging of A and B will look like:

A[1  5  7]     B[2  6  8]

Merging [1  2]  --> incremement count of 5 and 7 by 1. 

Merging [1  2 5  6] ---> increment count of 7 by 1.

This approach will work. But, we will need an inner loop to increment count of all the following elements of A. This will cause TLE. Can we do better?



Yes, simply count how many times a number is moving from B to A. Every time you are merging a number from A, add that count to that index like:

class Solution {
    void countSmaller(vector<int>& nums, vector<int>& indices,
                      int start, int end, vector<int> &res) {

        int mid = (start + end) >> 1;

        if (start == end)////<<<<<<Base condition is array size 1
            return;

        countSmaller (nums, indices, start, mid, res);
        countSmaller (nums, indices, mid + 1, end, res);

        int num_moves = 0;
        for (int i = 0, j = start, k = mid + 1; i < end - start + 1; i++) {//////<<<<Note that here, index should run from start-to-end,  not 0-to-n
            if (j <= mid && k <= end) {
                if (nums[indices[j]] <= nums[indices[k]]) {
                    res[indices[j]] += num_moves;////<<<When you are merging a number from A, use the count
                    tmp[i] = indices[j++]; 
                } else {
                    num_moves++;///////<<<<< When a number moves from B to A, increment the count.
                    tmp[i] = indices[k++];
                }
            } else if (j <= mid) {
                res[indices[j]] += num_moves;////<<<When you are merging a number from A, use the count
                tmp[i] = indices[j++];
            } else {
                tmp[i] = indices[k++];
            }
        }
        move(tmp.begin(), tmp.end(), indices.begin() + start);////<<<< This is how you can do something like memcpy()
    }
public:
    vector<int> countSmaller(vector<int>& nums) {
        int n = nums.size();

        vector<int> res(n);
        vector<int> indices(n);///<<<Note that, we cannot modify the actual array. So, use this approach. I sometimes think of using hash for this, but don't do that.

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)///<<<<Use index to sort the array
            indices[i] = i;

        countSmaller(nums, indices, 0, n - 1, res);

        return res;
    }
};


98. What's wrong with the code?

if (nums[m] > (nums[k] * 2))

Merge sort. How would you implement this during merging?


For instance, you have these two sorted arrays. How would you implement intended logic while merging?

A[2, 7, 9]   B[3, 4, 10]


I mistakenly think that, we need to implement the logic while merging logic. But, that's not necessarily true. You can implement the logic given you are given two sorted arrays. Then you can implement naive merging. ///////<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<


Now, how would you implement the logic given you are given two sorted arrays?

The solution I came up was, I will iterate both array from right to left. The steps are shown below.
        i             j

     i            j

     i         j
A[2, 7, 9]   B[3, 4, 10]    A[i] > 2 * B[j] is true. count += 1

        int to_insert;                  
        int mid = (start + end) >> 1;

        reversePairs (nums, start, mid, count);

How would you implement this?

I initialially thought storing prefix sum would work. But, will it?

We will need prefix sum, but it should contain different things. For instance, you are given following input. What would your prefix sum matrix look like? How would you calculate 
range sum from there?

--------------------------
|  2  |   3  |  -1 |  -2  |
...........................
|  4  |   3  |  -2 |  5   |
---------------------------
|  1  |   2  |  3  |  4   |
---------------------------
|  -2  |  3  |  2  |  2   |
---------------------------

Each point i, j will contain sum of all the elements of submatrix (0,0) and (i,j) as following

--------------------------
|  2  |   5  |   4 |  2  |
...........................
|  6  |   12 |   9 |  11 |
---------------------------
|  9  |   15 |     |     |
---------------------------
|  7  |     |     |      |
---------------------------


Then you can use geometric concept to calculate range sum. If you can't find the solution, look at my own solution.


Now, how would you calculate prefix sum of the matrix? Note that, it's easy to calculate prefix sum of all the elements from (0, 0) to (i,j). But, calculing prefix sum in submatrix can be tricky. But, we can calculate it like DP. First calculte the prefix sum of first column. Then  first row. Then based on left and up value, we can calculate the current value. For deatils, look at my own solution.


101. How to calculate prefix sum of an array?

I tend to do this as:

  int running_sum = 0;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    running_sum += nums[i];
    prefix_sum[i] = running_sum;
  }

But, can you do it better?

It can be better written as:

        prefix_sum[0] = sums[0];
        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            prefix_sum[i] = prefix_sum[i-1] + nums[i]; 
        }


102. https://leetcode.com/problems/count-of-range-sum/

How would you implememt this?

I remember from memory that it's a merge sort, but how would you implement merge sort in this problem?

Typical way to solve this problem is to create prefix sum array. Then, for each element, find the difference from other elements and check if the difference is in the range. This will require O(n^2). Can you do it better?

The trick is, when we do merge sort, we have two partitions sorted. If partition are sorted, we don't need to check all the combination. For instance, we have two partitions:

A[-2 0 3 5] B[-5 -1 0 4 5] Target range is [-4, 4]

How would you find the count of range sum?


I tend to find a O(n) solution, but that's not possible.

For each element of A, find the smallest element in B for B[j] - A[i] >= lower. Also find the largest element in B for which B[k] - A[i] <= upper.
Then, for A[i], the count += k - j + 1;

This is how we can avoid serach the whole array. If needed, look at my own solution.

My implementation is getting TLE although same algorithm in C is working fine.

Moral of the story: I tend to think that, when we need to count how many elements migrate from right partition to left partition, only then we use merge sort. But, that's not true.
We can use merge sort for any application. When we need to iterate an array and the array is not sorted and our algorithm can be improved with sorted array, it's possible to use merge sort and apply our operation on the partition rather than the whole array.

How would you implement it?

I tend to think of using sliding window algorithm. But, is it the right solution?

I tend to think that if I don't find a match, from where I would start looking in the 'pattern' string. But, is it the right solution?

Later I figured out that this is not a sliding-window algorithm at all. In brut-force approach, we check the whole pattern for the each character of the haystack string. But, this is not right. Anytime we find a un-match, we can skip check for all the character that doesn't match the first character of the 'pattern'. This solution is accepted in leetcode.


But, look carefully. This is same is native implememtation. In naive implementation, we also skip if it doesn't match the first character of the pattern. And naive solution is also accepted in leetcode.


Better solution in KMP algorithm. KMP algorithm is only good if the pattern string has lots of repeattative characters. If there is not much repeative characters, KMP will not provide any improvement. So, it may not make much sense.

For instance, if pattern and string is as following: 

AAAAAAAAbbbbbAAAAAAA -- pattern
      ^ 
      |
AAAAAABAbBBBBAAAAAA  --- input text


Here, we found an unmatch. In this case, naive approach would do as follows:

 AAAAAAAAbbbbbAAAAAAA -- pattern
 ^ 
 |
AAAAAABAbBBBBAAAAAA  --- input text


KMP will instead do as following:    

AAAAAAAAbbbbbAAAAAAA -- pattern
     ^ 
     |
AAAAAABAbBBBBAAAAAA  --- input text


Note that, KMP will be beneficial only of pattern has lots of substrings that can be prefix of the pattern. As this is such a unique characteristics, we don't implement KMP

105. https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-string-with-substrings-representing-1-to-n/

How would you implement this?

I found this problem difficult. Sometimes, I found problem difficcult because I try to over-optimize it. If it seems difficult, find a naive version first, then try to optimize it. Don't try to optimize it from the get go.

Sometimes, it helps to avoid complexities if you know what can be done and what can't be done.

For instance, we already know that there is no good solution to find sub string in a string (KMP only help in certain case). So, we know that, we have no scope of optimizing of checking all the substrings.

So, we can try to optimize string generation from number. How can you generate bitstring of all the number from 1 to n?

We can do it it a loop. If right-most bit of a number is 0, in next number, right-most bit will be 1.

If right-most bit is 1, the we need to do as:

10001000111 to 10001001000

How can we do that?

You can manually count how many 1's do you have in a loop. Can you do better?

If      a = 10001000111
       a+1= 10001001000
-----------------------
a ^ (a+1) = 00000001111

From here, you simply can count show many 1's do you have. 

The code looks like:

    vector<string> getBinStr(int n) {
        vector<string> res;
        string s = "1";

        res.push_back(s);
        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            if ((i & 1) == 0) {
                s[s.length() - 1] = '1';
            } else {
                int num = ((i ^ (i + 1)) >> 1) + 1;
                int count = log10(num) / log10(2);
                if (s.length() == count) {
                    s.insert(0, "1");
                }
                s[s.length() - count - 1] = '1';
                for (int k = s.length() - count; k < s.length(); k++) {
                    s[k] = '0';
                }
            }
            res.push_back(s);
        }
        return res;
    }
    
Unfortunately it still gets TLE. Another solution can be as follows:

    vector<string> getBinStr(int n) {
        vector<string> res;
        queue<string> q;
        string cur;

        q.push("1");
        int i = 0;
        while (i < n) {
            cur = q.front();
            res.push_back(cur);
            i++;
            q.pop();
            q.push(cur + "0");
            q.push(cur + "1");
        }
        return res;
    }
    
The idea is taken from https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/interesting-method-generate-binary-numbers-1-n/. Unfortunately, it also gets TLE
