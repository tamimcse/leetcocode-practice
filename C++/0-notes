1. Palindrome - an integer is a palindrome when it reads the same backward as forward. For example, 121 is a palindrome while 123 is not.

2. Ask if input consists of just letter, or any ASCII character. For instance, in https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-substring-without-repeating-characters/, I thought it will only contain english letter, and I use arr[26] as a hash. This is not right. The input can contain both upper case and lower case. More importantly, it can contain any ascii charecter.

3. Note that, there are 256 ascii characters.

4. In  sliding window implementation, you can start end = [0 - end] and increase start on the way

5. Suppose you are given https://leetcode.com/problems/median-of-two-sorted-arrays/. You need to asked to solve in log (n + m). How would you do that? Actually, if you use two pointers for two arrays, it's actually log (n + m). This is because you don't need to iterate the whole array. Actually, no that's not right. If you use simple, two pointers, it's O(n+m). However, I saw my solution  was accepted and it was faster that 99...% solutions

6. https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-integer/. Here, I thought, I will have to rotate the number in each step up to n times (n = num of digits). If you think clearly, if you ratate a number n times, you will get the same number. If you rotate n - 1 times, it will still give you wrong results. To get the right results, you need to swap between start and end.

7. We know that C++ string is immutatable. If we append or use '+' operator, it creates a new copy of the object. So, you may want to create a sring of a predefined length. You can do that as:

        string res(str_len, 0);//Here, we are assigning 0/NULL to each element of the string
        
8. https://leetcode.com/problems/base-7/. How many characters do you need for base 7? How do you convert a number from base 10 to base 7?

Recall that, for base-10 numbers, we can calculate the number of digits as = log10(num) + 1. It will work for any number, for instance, 99, 100,...

In the same way, base-2 number, the number of binary digits is = log2(num) + 1.

In the same way, for base-7 number, the number of digits = log7(num) + 1.

How to calculate log7(num)? There is no such library function.

log7(num) = log10(num) / log10(7).

Note that, this will not work if the number is negative. So, if the number is negative, you need to make it positive and then process it.


How do calculate base-7 number from base-10? 

Recall that, in Base-16, we divide by 16 in each step, and get the quotient (result of the division) and remainder. We divide the quotient again by 16. We repeat these utill quotient is 0. Like:

16 |45
   |---------------------
16 |2 - 13 (D)
   -----------------------
   |0  - 2 (2)
   
So, Hex of 45 is 2D   

In the same way, for base-7, we need to divide by 7.

Will this work if input is 0? No. You need to handle 0 separately. If the number is negative, you also need to make the number positive first.

9. https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-linked-list/ Here, I need to set head = nullptr.

10. https://leetcode.com/problems/convert-sorted-array-to-binary-search-tree/ Here, we can use mid = (start + end) >> 1

11. https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-bits/. Note that reversing is not same as circulating. I often make this mistake. Remember string reverse procedure

12. https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-bits/ Here, if (n & mask2 == 0) will not work. It should be if ((n & mask2) == 0)

13. https://leetcode.com/problems/linked-list-cycle-ii/. Detecting cycle is easy. How would you find the start of the cycle?

Don't go into theory. That's just for correctness proof. Idea is only you find the intersection of fast and slow pointer, do the following. Have ptr1 point the head and have ptr2 point the intersection. Then go only one step at a time for both case. When they meet, that's the start of the cycle.

14. https://leetcode.com/problems/invert-binary-tree/

Here, I set left-subtree = invert(right-subtree). Problem here is it will update the tree in place. Don't do that. Create a temp, left, right. Then update the tree based on left and right as:

        TreeNode *left = invertTree (root->right);
        TreeNode *right = invertTree (root->left);
        root->left = left;
        root->right = right;

15. https://leetcode.com/problems/sqrtx/

A binary search needs to be in the form:

while (end >= start) {//Not end > start
  mid = (start + end) >> 1;
  if (target == arr[mid])
    return mid;
  else if (target > arr[mid])
    start = mid + 1;//NOT start = mid (leads to infinite loop)
  else
    end = mid - 1;  //NOT end = mid (leads to infinite loop)
}

Also, in the problem, don't do:

 if ((x + 1) * (x + 1) > target) 
 
 What's wrong here? It may overflow for some input. Even if(x + x > target) or if (x * x > target) may overflow.
 
 If you need to calculate sum or multiplication of int/float, check if you need "long long" (for int) or "double" (for float) to store it. Otherwise overflow happens. If you need long long or double, also change the expression to make sure that longlong or double is stored. For instance,

int a, b;
long long sum;

sum = (long long)a + b;

Just changing to long long inline doesn't work.

In some cases, you may not need "long long". Just "long" is enough.

16. https://leetcode.com/problems/kth-largest-element-in-a-stream/

What's wrong with the code?

	vector<int> nums;
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.size() - k; i++) {

        }
        
Here, nums.size() is unsigned. If nums.size() - k is negative, that expression will accidentally create a large number. So, the loop will mistakenly run many iteration whearas it shouldn't iterate at all.
        
Following doesn't fix it.


        for (int i = 0; i < (int)nums.size() - k; i++) {

        }
        
This however fixes it:
        
        int num_delete = nums.size() - k;
        for (int i = 0; i < num_delete; i++) {

        }
        
17. https://leetcode.com/problems/power-of-three/ 

Look at the following solution:

    bool isPowerOfThree(int n) {
        if (n <= 0)
            return false;
        
       float x = (float)log10(n) / log10(3);
       return ceil(x) == x;//See how we are checking if x is an integer.
    }
    
    What's wrong with the code? Here, it should be:
    
    double x = log10(n) / log10(3);
    
    Casting it to float may lose precision, which causes wrong result. Also, x should be double.
    
18. https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/position-of-rightmost-set-bit/

The process is:
     
    unsigned int getFirstSetBitPos(int n)
    {
        return log2(n & -n) + 1;
    }
    
    If you take negative of the number (two's complement) and & it with the original #, all the bits except the right most one is set. Then, use log to calculate the bit position.
    
    For instance, n = 100011100
    
    One's complement of n = 011100011
    Two's complement of n = 011100100. This is -n
    
    Now, n & -n = 100.

20. https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-days-between-two-dates/. How to solve this? Trying to implement distance between them is hard/messy to implement. But, if you try to calculate # of days since 1970, that's clean to implemt. So, implement that, and then take the distance as:

class Solution {
    bool is_leapyear(int year) {
        if (year % 100 == 0)
            return year % 400 == 0;
        return (year % 4 == 0);
    }
    
    int since_epoc (string date) {
        int months[] = {0, 31, 28, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31};
        int year = stoi(date.substr(0, 4));
        int mon = stoi(date.substr(5, 2));
        int day = stoi(date.substr(8));
        
        int i = 1970;
        while (year > i) {
            day += is_leapyear(i) ? 366 : 365;
            i++;
        }
        for (int i = 1; i <= mon - 1; i++) {
            day += months[i];
            if (i == 2 && is_leapyear(year))
                day++;
        }
        return day;
    }
public:
    int daysBetweenDates(string date1, string date2) {
        //cout << since_epoc (date2);
        return abs(since_epoc (date2) -  since_epoc (date1));
    }
};

Note how we represented # of days in a month. That's more clean than having switch/if to clauclate it.

21. https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-square/

Very interesting problem. Try to find how you would solve it. 

Trick is to sort the numbers. That way, you know what is the bottom left and top right.

22. https://leetcode.com/problems/snakes-and-ladders/

How would you convert <x, y> to the number? Think in terms of math. Here, we are doing that:

            for (int j = 0; j < board.size(); j++) {
                if (right)
                    jump[(board.size() - 1 - i) * board.size() + j + 1] = board[i][j];
                else
                    jump[(board.size() - 1 - i) * board.size() + (board.size() - 1- j) + 1] = board[i][j];

        }   
    
23. https://leetcode.com/problems/product-of-array-except-self/

How can you implement this without using division?

You can have two arrays L and R. L will contain multiplication of all the number to the left of index i. R will contain multiplication of all the number to the right of index i.
Then for each index, you can do L[i] * R[i]     


24. https://leetcode.com/problems/3sum/

Here, challenge is how to make sure you don't put same result twice?

You may try to use hash. But, it will not work. Beacuse, the numbers inside result will not be in the same order. Besides, you iterate samrtly so that you can avoid duplicate.

First of all, sort the array. In outer array, check if the number you are dealing is same as the previous number. If yes, you can skip that.

In the inner array where you are doing two sum, if you find a match for a number, increase the index until the next number is same as the previous number. 

The code will look as following:

class Solution {
public:
    vector<vector<int>> threeSum(vector<int>& nums) {
        vector<vector<int>> res;
        int target_sum;
        
        sort (nums.begin(), nums.end());////<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.size() - 2; i++) {
            if (i > 0 && nums[i] == nums[i-1]) {////<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<
                continue;
            }
            target_sum = 0 - nums[i];
            unordered_set<int> set;
            for (int j = i + 1; j < nums.size();) {
                if (set.count(target_sum - nums[j])) {
                    vector<int> inner (3);
                    inner[0] = nums[i];
                    inner[1] = nums[j];
                    inner[2] = target_sum - nums[j];
                    res.push_back(inner);
                    j++;
                    while (j < nums.size() && nums[j] == nums[j-1])////<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<
                        j++;
                    continue;
                }
                set.insert(nums[j]);
                j++;
            }
        }
        return res;
    }
};

25. https://leetcode.com/problems/3sum-closest/

How do you calculate the distance between target and sum? Note that, both can be positive and negative.

When doing this, I made it overly complicated, and created a separte function for this. But, it should be abs(target - sum). Think about it. It will work for both positive and negative.

Now how would you implement this?

What I thought was, I would use two pointer approach. I will keep track of the last diff. In two pointer iteration, I would minimize the diff. If we see that diff is increasing compared to previous diff, we should break. This is not right. If diff increases, you should not break because you can still find a smaller diff. Then what's the point of using two pointers? The main benefit is, if we find a diff 0, we can immediately stop.

I also was thinking about 3 nested loop, because I though the inner loop will stop pretty soon. This is not the right approach either. First of all, this is O(n^3). Two pointer approach make the same problem O(n^2)

26. https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-connected-components-in-an-undirected-graph/

Do you implemement using DFS or BFS? I think, both solution works. But, text books are other solutions uses DFS instead of BFS. I didn't find a good explanation why. At first, I though DFS would be better because we don't really iterate all the edges. As DFS goes to depth first, it will find the solution sooner. But, this is not the case. Both DFS and BFS is O(E + V). DFS will eventually check all the edges of the nodes along the way (if the node isn't already visited). So, I think, there is a chance that DFS would be better, but it's not certain.

Also, how would you create adjacency list here?

I am inclind to think that, here I can create it as:

        for (auto &e : edges) {
            adj_list[e[0]].push_back(e[1]);
        } 
As I am primarily interested to mark all the nodes, so I don't really consider opposite direction of the edge. This however will not work in all the cases. We don't know which we will be visiting the nodes. So, correct answer should be: 
        
        for (auto &e : edges) {
            adj_list[e[0]].push_back(e[1]);
            adj_list[e[1]].push_back(e[0]);
        }
        
        
27. https://leetcode.com/problems/delete-node-in-a-linked-list/

30. https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock/

How would you implement this?

I generally think that, I will find a min to the left and max to the right. Then I will increase the min until I find a lower min. I usually do this because I treat loop as stateless loop. But, we can add state in a loop and do wonderful things. Try to find out if we can have multiple states so that we can find it in one iteration. If you can't, look at the leetcode solution.

31. How to implement heap? priority queue. How to implement max heap? This is simply:

priority_queue<int> q;
p.top()//Note this is not p.front()

For min heap, it should be:

priority_queue<int, vector<int>, greater<int>> pq;//yes, greater<int>, not 'greater' or 'less'. You also need to add vector<int>  

Also, note that priority queue can have size as: pq.size() 

32. https://leetcode.com/problems/validate-binary-search-tree/

How would you implement this? It may look simple on the surface, but note that all the nodes in left subtree has to be smaller. Try to find the solution. Look at my solution if you can't find.

Here is the soluton.

class Solution {
    bool isValidBST_inner(TreeNode* root, long min, long max) {//<<<<<<<<<<<<
        if (!root)
            return true;
        if (root->left && root->left->val >= root->val)
            return false;
        if (root->right && root->right->val <= root->val)
            return false;
        
        if (root->val >= max || root->val <= min)
            return false;
        
        return isValidBST_inner(root->left, min, root->val) && 
               isValidBST_inner(root->right, root->val, max);        
    }
public:
    bool isValidBST(TreeNode* root) {
        return isValidBST_inner(root, (long)INT_MIN * 2, (long)INT_MAX * 2);//<<<<<<<<<<<<
    }
};

Note that the pointers. You can actually avoid it by passing node pointer instead of the value (as leetcode solution suggests)

Note that, this problem can be solved using in-order travarsal. If you do in-order travarsal, the nodes will be visited in sorted order. Implementing in-order in recursive manner is easy, but implementing it in iterative manner isn't easy. Here. we are implementing it using recursive in-order.

class Solution {
    
    bool isValidBST_inner(TreeNode* root, TreeNode* &prev) {
        bool ret;
        
        if (!root)h?
            return true;
        ret = isValidBST_inner(root->left, prev);
        if (!ret)
            return false;
        if (prev && root->val <= prev->val)
            return false;
        prev = root;
        ret = isValidBST_inner(root->right, prev);
        if (!ret)
            return false;
        return true;
    }

public:
    bool isValidBST(TreeNode* root) {
        TreeNode* prev = nullptr;
        return isValidBST_inner(root, prev);///<<<<<<
    }
};

Note that, if you try to pass a default value at the pointer, the program will be error prone. Passing pointer is less error prone.


33. https://leetcode.com/problems/search-in-rotated-sorted-array/

How would you implement this? What I try to do is do binary search. During binary search, I try to increase/decrase the mid based on which part I'm in. I found it extreamly difficult to solve although leetcode solution 2 use the same approach. Easier approach is to use binary search to find the smallest element. Then do two separate binary search on two parts.

How would you find the smallest element using binary search? To solve this problem (like stock buy sell problem), draw the points as following:

Suppose, you want to implemenmt Kruskal's algorithm. How would you implement it?

How would you check cycle in it? DFS? I sometimes think that I can keep track of visit[] for each point. Can I use that to detect cycle?

You can't. Think of the following:

A     C
|     |
|     |
B     D

All the points are visited, but you can still add edge between A and C. 

So, detecting cycle in graph using DFS is expensive. You can use the above intuition to implement disjoint set data structure.

How would you implement disjoint set?

One option is to have a vector<unordered_set<int>>. This is expesive. How would you merge disjoint sets? We need a data structure that supports that.

class DisjointSet {
    vector<int> parent;
public:    
    DisjointSet (int n) {
        parent = vector<int>(n);//<<<<<<< See how we are creating a vector dynamically for member variable
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
            parent[i] = i;
    }
    
    int find (int n) {//<<<< find
        while (n != parent[n]) {
            n = parent[n];
        }
        return n;
    }
    
    bool merge (int a, int b) {//<<<< Merge
        int p1 = find (a);
        int p2 = find (b);
        
        if (p1 == p2)
            return false;
        parent[p1] = p2;
        return true;
    }
};

The total solution is:

class Solution {

    int minCostConnectPoints(vector<vector<int>>& points) {
        vector<vector<int>> edge_list;

How would you implement this? Note that, sometimes it's OK to create a dummy pointer (ListNode dummyNode), just to avoid complicated check;

39. https://leetcode.com/problems/all-paths-from-source-to-target/

How would you implement it? Note that, you need to implement backtracking in DFS. It is easier to implement backtacking DFS in recursive manner instead of iteratve manner.

40. https://leetcode.com/problems/powx-n/

How would you implememnt this?

I generally do: pow (x, n/2) * pow (x, n - n/2). But, note that, you are calling almost similar function twice. This will result in TLE. You can rather do:

            res = myPow(x, n/2);
            res = res * res;
            if (n & 1)
                res *= x;
                
Also, note that, if n is negative, you need to do n = -n. This will however cause overflow for the largest negative integer. To solve this problem, do following:

        long N = n;
        bool neg = n < 0;

        if (neg)
            N = -N;                

41. https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-integer/

How to solve this? I generally solve as:

https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-integer/

class Solution {
public:
    int reverse(int x) {
        unsigned int X = x < 0 ? -x : x;//<<<<<<Can it cause overflow? Ypu would think No, because it's unsigned. But it will overflow. Use abs() to achive this

        unsigned int num = 0;
        while (X) {
            num = num * 10 + X % 10;//<<<<<<Can it cause overflow? Yes. I usually solve this uinng "long" or "long long", but we cannot use 64 bit int here. 
            X = X/10;
        }

        return x < 0 ? -num : num;
    }
};

Note that, not being able to use 64 bit int is the main challenge here. We need to implement in a way that it can detect overflow. Now, we need to detect overflow before it actually happens. Because if overflow happens, you cannot detect it. So, we can use following approach:

class Solution {
public:
    int reverse(int x) {
        bool neg = x < 0;
        unsigned int X = abs(x);///<<< Don't do -x. It will cause overflow

        unsigned int num = 0;
        while (X) {
            if (!neg && (num > INT_MAX/10 || (num == INT_MAX/10 && X % 10 > 7))) {///<<<<<See how we are avoiding overflow for positive #
                return 0;
            }
            if (neg && (num > INT_MAX/10 || (num == INT_MAX/10 && X % 10 > 8))) {///<<<<<See how we are avoiding overflow for negative #
                return 0;
            }
            num = num * 10 + X % 10;
            X = X/10;
        }

        return neg ? -num : num;
    }
};  

42. https://leetcode.com/problems/lru-cache/

How would you implememnt this? 

I tend to use hash and heap. I also though about using hash and queue. But, if you think carefully, they will not work. But, note that, you can implment using hash + linked list where hash points to the linked list nodes. Everytime you access a node, that node will be pushed to the head. When we delete a node, we will be delete from tail. Which linked list should you use? should you use std::list?

I found that moving around items can be difficult in std::list. So, avoid it. Implement your own list unless what you are doing something trivial like push_back(), pop_back(), push_front(), pop_front(). Note that, std::list has those functions. Although list has splice() that allows you to insert one list into another, it's hard to use if you want to reorder nodes in a list using it.

Now, would you use single linked list or double linked list? Note that, here double linked list will result in O(1) reoorder (although Single linked list also can have tail)

When implementing linked list of your own, don't forget to do these:

class Node {
public:
    int key;
    int val;
    Node *next;
    Node *prev;
    Node(int k, int v) {
        key = k;
        val = v;
        next = nullptr;//<<<<<<<<I usually forget this
        prev = nullptr;//<<<<<<<<I usually forget this
    }
};

Also, remember that hash has size() function that can give us the size. Hash also has following way to delete a key:

hash.erase(key_to_del);//<<<<You don't need to pass an iterator

43. https://leetcode.com/problems/lfu-cache/

How would you implememt this? 

I think of implememting as hash + priority_queue. Here, priority_queue will contain the nodes (with frequency) and hash points to the node. This however will not work. Because, in C++ priority_queue, you only get top and you can only do push() which will add the item to the bottom of the tree. But, in this case, we may need to update the frequency of an intermediate node. If you do that, priority_queue acts abnormally. To solve this, we can implement our own heap.

Now, even though we don't use heap, let's take a how the heap code would look like:

struct Elem {//<<<<<<<Note that stuct/class name should begin with capital letter.
    int key;
    int val;
    int freq;
    Elem(int k, int v, int f) {//<<<<<<<<<<<<You can add constructor in struct like a class
        key = k;
        val = v;
        freq = f;
    }
};

unordered_map<int, Elem *> hash;//<<<<<Notde that, you don't need struct keyword for struct
Elem *new_elem = new Elem(key, value, 1);//You can also create a struct onbject like a class

//<<<<<Note how functor is written
struct Comp{
    bool operator()(Elem *e1, Elem *e2){//<<< Note that there are two "()". You also need to return true
        return e1->freq < e2->freq;
    }
};

priority_queue<Elem *, vector<Elem *>, Comp> pq;//<<<<<For custom object, we need to give less/greater than function. Here, we need to provide a functor
               
Now, even though you could implement your own heap, that will require you update multiple elements in every iteration. Can you do better?

Yes, you can have a hash<frequency, nodelist>. Here, you will keep all the nodes that have the same frequency in the same bucket. When you update the frequency, you simply need to move the node from current bucket to new bucket. You may think that, here we need linear search to find the node. But, actually you don't. Note that, each node is allocated dynamically. Here, we simply keep the pointer to the node, not the actual node. So, this frequncy hash and key hash will point to the same node. You can move nodes easily around.

You so you need to two hash, right? One keep track of <key, Node*>, another <freq, node>. But, note that, in case of <freq, node>, you sometimes need to find the smallest frequncy? How can you do that. Use map!!!! Remember that map is an ordered_map (internally a red black tree). So, you can easily find the smallest freq as:

map.begin()..

Now, in the requirment it also says that, if there are multiple LFU element, evict the LRU element. So, you need to keep track of the LRU as well. So, solve this problem, we always insert at the end of the list and evict from the head of the list. To implemement that efficiently, we need both head and tail. So, this is the actual implementation:

/*

struct Node {
    int key;
    int val;
    int freq;
    Node *next;

        prev = NULL;
    }
};

44. How would you implement a unorded_map<pair<int, int>, bool>? Note that, this will not work because it does not know how to use pair<int, int> as key. In  43, we defined priority_queue with custom object. There we implemented () oprator in Cmp. I'm not sure if that was right, because it didn't implement it fully. I later tried the same approach here. It didn't work. But, following approach work.

struct Cmp {
    int operator()(const pair<int, int> &p1) const {//<<< Note that you need two "()". Parameter and function has to be const. You need to pass just one pair, not two. You also need to return int, not bool.
        return p1.first * 8 + p1.second;
    }    
};

unordered_map<pair<int, int>, bool, Cmp> h;

Howwould you use hashset instead? I often forget this.

It would be like:

unordered_set<int> hs;//<<<Not "hash_set" or "hashset"
hs.insert(5);//<<<<<<Not hs.push_back(5);

if (hs.count(5))//<<< this  is how we lookup.

We can also use find() in the same way as hash.
              
45. From Dr. Nesterenko's slide, you can append strings in two ways:

string s = "Hello";

s = s + " world";
s.append(" world");

Both are fine. Don't worry about creating stringbuffer.

Also, note that std::string doesn't have strcpy(). For instance, this will not compile:

tmp.strcpy(s, i, s_idx);

So, if you need to copy part of the string to another string, use "+".

Also note that, Following is not allowed!!!! (I often try this). Dr. Nesterenko's slide mentioned this
s = "Hello" + " world";//<<< You cannot apply "+" operartor on "Hello"


Also, how would you create a string of size 9?

string s(9)//<<<<Not right. This will work for vector, not for string.

Do this:

string s;
s.resize(9);

In most of time, create an empty string with "string s;". And then append to it.

How to earse part of the string?

tmp.erase(tmp_idx);//<<< Erase everything from tmp_idx to the end.
s.erase(0, num_spaces);//<<<It will erase num_spaces spaces from index 0


How to create substring? This is often used;

string sub = s.substr(offset, len);
string sub = s.substr(offset);//<<<In this case, it will return everything from the offset

How would you solve this?

I tend to use BFS. But, can you do better? Remember, if you need to do some sort of search, and the numbers are sorted, you can do better => Bibary search.

How would implement binary search here? This is not very clean. Pretty messy. Can you do better?

How about do DFS from top-right or bottom left? What is the benefit? Search space is shrinked. If we start from top-left and bottom-right, search space is huge, because both in creasing or descreasing. If you start from top-right, you only need to visit either left or down. Note that, you don't really need DFS here.
